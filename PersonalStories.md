# Recovery Dharma - Personal Recovery Stories

## Chapter 40: Amy

### ID: p40-1
Whenever I told my story, I usually started with "I am a nice Catholic girl from the suburbs." I always got a laugh. Growing up in a Catholic family and community, life revolved around my local parish, school, Sunday dinners with grandparents and lots of cousins. I come from a large family and we are very close. My parents are still married after fifty-five years and are each other's best friends. I also have a twin sister. I love being a twin! I was and still am fortunate to have many blessings in my life.

### ID: p40-2
However, I have also experienced many challenges. I was sexually molested by two stepbrothers when I was four years old and later by a cousin when I was ten. My parents did not know what was going on, and they did the best they could with the information they had at the time. These traumatic experiences were my introduction to feelings of shame and fear.

### ID: p40-3
From a young age, I began to separate my inner feelings from my outward persona. I was a good student, involved in sports and student government. I was popular and had a lot of friends. Yet I always felt disconnected from my peers. I often felt nervous and anxious. I was highly sensitive to people's moods and I took on their emotions as my own. I also experienced a feeling of impending doom most of the time.

### ID: p40-4
When I was fourteen, I was at a high school party and someone passed me a joint. I took a hit. This was my first experience with marijuana and I loved the feeling of relief it gave me. I finally felt free from the fear and shame I had been carrying. This was the beginning of my using career.

### ID: p40-5
From there, my drug use escalated. I started drinking alcohol and smoking pot regularly. By the time I was sixteen, I was experimenting with psychedelics. I loved the escape these drugs provided. However, I was still maintaining good grades and participating in school activities, so no one suspected I had a problem.

### ID: p40-6
When I went away to college, my using intensified. I started using cocaine and would stay up for days partying. I was date raped my freshman year but didn't tell anyone because I blamed myself. This experience added to my feelings of shame and unworthiness.

### ID: p40-7
After college, I moved back home and started working. I continued using drugs and alcohol, but now I was functioning in the "real world." I held down jobs, had relationships, and appeared to have it all together on the outside. But inside, I was dying. The drugs and alcohol were no longer giving me the relief I sought. Instead, they were causing me more pain and suffering.

### ID: p40-8
I tried to quit on my own many times, but I couldn't stay stopped. I would go a few days or weeks without using, but then I would convince myself I could handle it and would start using again. Each time I relapsed, the consequences became more severe. I lost jobs, relationships, and my self-respect. I was filled with self-loathing and despair.

### ID: p40-9
In my late twenties, I hit my bottom. I was suicidal and didn't want to live anymore. I had lost everything that mattered to me. With the help of my family, I entered treatment for the first time. This was the beginning of my recovery journey.

### ID: p40-10
In treatment, I was introduced to the Twelve Steps. I also began to learn about meditation and mindfulness practices. These tools gave me a new way to cope with my feelings and emotions. I began to understand that I was not a bad person trying to be good, but a sick person trying to get well.

### ID: p40-11
After leaving treatment, I got involved in a Twelve Step fellowship. I found a sponsor, worked the steps, and started attending meetings regularly. I also continued to practice meditation and mindfulness. These practices helped me to stay connected to myself and to a power greater than myself.

### ID: p40-12
Through recovery, I have learned to accept myself and my past. I have learned to forgive myself and others. I have learned that my sensitivity is actually a gift, not a curse. I have learned to set boundaries and to take care of myself. Most importantly, I have learned that I am worthy of love and belonging.

### ID: p40-13
Today, I am grateful for my recovery and for the life I have been given. I am grateful for my family, my friends, and my recovery community. I am grateful for the opportunity to help others who are struggling with addiction. Recovery has given me a life beyond my wildest dreams.

## Chapter 41: Chance

### ID: p41-1
I was introduced to drugs and alcohol at a very young age. My father was a drug dealer and my mother was an addict. Drugs and alcohol were a normal part of my childhood. I started using marijuana when I was eight years old and was drinking alcohol by the time I was ten.

### ID: p41-2
My childhood was chaotic and traumatic. My parents were often fighting, and there was a lot of violence in our home. I witnessed my father beat my mother on multiple occasions. I also experienced physical and emotional abuse from both of my parents. I learned early on that the world was not a safe place.

### ID: p41-3
By the time I was a teenager, I was using drugs and alcohol heavily. I was also involved in criminal activity, including selling drugs and stealing. I dropped out of high school and was in and out of juvenile detention centers. I had no direction in my life and no hope for the future.

### ID: p41-4
When I was seventeen, I was arrested for armed robbery and sentenced to five years in prison. This was a wake-up call for me. While in prison, I had a lot of time to think about my life and where I was headed. I realized that if I didn't make some changes, I was going to end up dead or in prison for the rest of my life.

### ID: p41-5
In prison, I was introduced to meditation and Buddhist philosophy through a program offered by a local Buddhist center. I was skeptical at first, but I decided to give it a try. I had nothing to lose. What I found was a new way of looking at life and a new way of being in the world.

### ID: p41-6
Through meditation, I began to see my thoughts and emotions more clearly. I began to understand how my past experiences had shaped my beliefs and behaviors. I began to see that I had a choice in how I responded to my thoughts and emotions. This was a revolutionary concept for me.

### ID: p41-7
When I was released from prison, I continued to practice meditation and study Buddhist philosophy. I also got involved in a recovery program and found a sponsor. I began to work the steps and attend meetings regularly. I was committed to changing my life.

### ID: p41-8
Recovery has not been easy. I have faced many challenges and obstacles along the way. I have struggled with cravings and triggers. I have dealt with difficult emotions and painful memories. But through it all, I have learned to stay present and to trust the process.

### ID: p41-9
One of the most important lessons I have learned in recovery is the importance of community. I used to think I had to do everything on my own, but I have learned that I need others to support me on this journey. The people in my recovery community have become my family. They have shown me what unconditional love and acceptance look like.

### ID: p41-10
Today, I am grateful for my recovery and for the life I have been given. I have a job that I love, healthy relationships, and a sense of purpose. I am able to help others who are struggling with addiction, and this gives me great joy. I never thought this kind of life was possible for me.

### ID: p41-11
The practices of Recovery Dharma have been instrumental in my recovery. The meditation practices help me to stay grounded and present. The Four Noble Truths help me to understand suffering and how to end it. The Eightfold Path gives me a guide for how to live my life. I am grateful to be part of this community and to have these tools to support my recovery.

## Chapter 42: Synyi

### ID: p42-1
I grew up in a small town in the Midwest. My parents divorced when I was young, and I lived with my mother and stepfather. My stepfather was an alcoholic and was often verbally and emotionally abusive. I learned to be quiet and invisible to avoid his rage.

### ID: p42-2
As a child, I was very shy and anxious. I had a hard time making friends and often felt like an outsider. I was a good student and threw myself into my schoolwork as a way to escape from my home life. I was also very creative and loved to draw and paint.

### ID: p42-3
When I was thirteen, I was introduced to alcohol at a party. I loved the feeling it gave me. For the first time in my life, I felt confident and outgoing. I felt like I could be myself without fear of judgment. This was the beginning of my relationship with alcohol.

### ID: p42-4
Throughout high school, I drank regularly. I also started experimenting with other drugs, including marijuana and prescription pills. I was able to maintain good grades and was involved in art classes and theater. On the outside, I appeared to be a typical teenager. But on the inside, I was struggling with anxiety and depression.

### ID: p42-5
After high school, I moved to a big city to attend art school. This is when my drinking and drug use really took off. I was surrounded by other artists who partied as hard as they worked. I fit right in. I was drinking and using drugs daily, but I convinced myself that this was just part of the creative lifestyle.

### ID: p42-6
Over the next several years, my addiction progressed. I started using cocaine and methamphetamine. I would stay up for days working on art projects and partying with friends. I was convinced that the drugs were helping me to be more creative, but in reality, they were destroying me.

### ID: p42-7
I dropped out of art school and took a series of odd jobs to support my drug habit. I was living in a constant state of chaos. I was in abusive relationships, living in unsafe situations, and putting myself in dangerous situations. I was arrested multiple times for drug possession and driving under the influence.

### ID: p42-8
Despite all of this, I continued to use. I couldn't imagine life without drugs and alcohol. They had become my best friends, my coping mechanism, my reason for living. The thought of giving them up filled me with terror.

### ID: p42-9
When I was thirty, I overdosed and nearly died. I woke up in the hospital with my mother by my side. She was crying and begging me to get help. I could see the pain and fear in her eyes, and for the first time, I felt a desire to change.

### ID: p42-10
I entered treatment and began my recovery journey. It was the hardest thing I had ever done. I had to face all of the pain and trauma that I had been running from for so many years. I had to learn how to live life on life's terms without the crutch of drugs and alcohol.

### ID: p42-11
In treatment, I was introduced to meditation and mindfulness practices. At first, I was resistant. I thought meditation was just sitting around doing nothing. But as I began to practice, I discovered a whole new way of being. I learned to observe my thoughts and emotions without judgment. I learned to be present in the moment. I learned to be kind to myself.

### ID: p42-12
After leaving treatment, I got involved in Recovery Dharma. I found a community of people who understood what I was going through and who supported me on my journey. I began to practice the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path. I began to see my addiction as a form of suffering that could be ended.

### ID: p42-13
Through recovery, I have reclaimed my creativity. I have started painting again, but now I do it from a place of joy and authenticity rather than from a place of escape. I have also discovered a passion for helping others in recovery. I facilitate a Recovery Dharma meeting and sponsor other women who are new to recovery.

### ID: p42-14
Today, I am grateful for my recovery and for the life I have been given. I have healthy relationships, a stable home, and a sense of purpose. I am no longer running from myself. Instead, I am embracing all aspects of who I am, including my past. Recovery has given me the gift of freedom.

Suicide

### ID: p43-2
I grew up in a loving family in a nice neighborhood. My parents were supportive and encouraged me to pursue my interests. I was a good student, played sports, and had plenty of friends. From the outside, it looked like I had a perfect life.

### ID: p43-3
But inside, I was struggling. I was gay, and I knew it from a young age. Growing up in a conservative community, I didn't feel safe being open about my sexuality. I lived in fear that someone would discover my secret and reject me. This fear consumed me and led to intense feelings of shame and isolation.

### ID: p43-4
When I was fifteen, I started drinking alcohol as a way to cope with my anxiety and depression. Alcohol helped me to numb the pain I was feeling and to forget about my problems, at least temporarily. It also gave me the courage to socialize and to fit in with my peers.

### ID: p43-5
By the time I went to college, I was drinking heavily and regularly. I was also experimenting with other drugs, including marijuana, ecstasy, and cocaine. I was living a double life – on the surface, I was a successful college student, but underneath, I was falling apart.

### ID: p43-6
In college, I came out as gay. I thought that being open about my sexuality would relieve some of my pain, and it did to some extent. But I had already established a pattern of using drugs and alcohol to cope with my emotions, and that pattern continued.

### ID: p43-7
After college, I moved to a big city and immersed myself in the gay party scene. I was using drugs and alcohol every day. I convinced myself that I was just having fun and enjoying my life, but in reality, I was spiraling out of control.

### ID: p43-8
My addiction led to a series of consequences. I lost jobs, relationships, and my self-respect. I was arrested for DUI and spent a night in jail. I contracted HIV because I was making poor decisions while under the influence. I became suicidal and attempted to take my own life multiple times.

### ID: p43-9
Despite all of this, I couldn't stop using. I tried to quit on my own many times, but I always relapsed. The drugs and alcohol had such a strong hold on me that I felt powerless to break free.

### ID: p43-10
When I was thirty-two, I had a moment of clarity. I was sitting alone in my apartment, high and drunk, and I looked at myself in the mirror. I didn't recognize the person staring back at me. I had become a shell of who I once was. In that moment, I knew I had to get help or I was going to die.

### ID: p43-11
I called a friend who was in recovery, and he helped me to find a treatment program. I entered treatment the next day. It was terrifying, but it was also the best decision I ever made.

### ID: p43-12
In treatment, I was introduced to the Twelve Steps and to meditation. I learned about the nature of addiction and how it had taken over my life. I learned that recovery was possible and that I deserved to be happy and healthy.

### ID: p43-13
After leaving treatment, I got involved in both a Twelve Step fellowship and in Recovery Dharma. I found that the combination of these two approaches worked well for me. The Twelve Steps gave me a structure for working through my past and making amends. Recovery Dharma gave me tools for staying present and for understanding the nature of my suffering.

### ID: p43-14
Through recovery, I have learned to accept myself fully, including my sexuality. I have learned that being gay is not something to be ashamed of, but rather something to celebrate. I have found a community of LGBTQ+ people in recovery who support and uplift me.

### ID: p43-15
I have also learned to manage my HIV diagnosis in a healthy way. I take my medication regularly, see my doctor, and take care of my physical health. I no longer see my HIV status as a punishment, but rather as a part of my story.

### ID: p43-16
Today, I am grateful to be alive. I am grateful for my recovery and for the opportunity to help others who are struggling. I work as a counselor at an LGBTQ+ youth center, and I facilitate a Recovery Dharma meeting for LGBTQ+ individuals. Helping others gives my life meaning and purpose.

### ID: p43-17
The practices of Recovery Dharma have been transformative for me. Meditation helps me to stay grounded and present. The Four Noble Truths help me to understand my suffering and how to end it. The practice of loving-kindness has helped me to develop compassion for myself and others. I am grateful to be part of this community.

Childhood sex abuse

### ID: p44-2
I was born in the Philippines and moved to the United States when I was five years old. My family settled in California, and I grew up in a community with a large Filipino population. My parents worked hard to provide for our family, and they instilled in me the importance of education and hard work.

### ID: p44-3
When I was seven years old, I was sexually abused by a family friend. The abuse continued for several years. I didn't tell anyone because I was ashamed and scared. I buried the trauma deep inside and tried to pretend it never happened.

### ID: p44-4
As a result of the abuse, I developed anxiety and depression at a young age. I also struggled with my self-esteem and had a hard time trusting others. I threw myself into my schoolwork as a way to cope, and I became a perfectionist. I believed that if I could just be perfect, then maybe I would be worthy of love.

### ID: p44-5
In high school, I was introduced to alcohol at a party. I immediately loved the way it made me feel. It quieted the anxiety and made me feel more confident. I started drinking regularly and also began experimenting with marijuana and prescription pills.

### ID: p44-6
I went to college and continued my pattern of using drugs and alcohol to cope with my emotions. I was a high-functioning addict, maintaining good grades and appearing to have it all together. But inside, I was struggling. I was in abusive relationships, engaging in risky behaviors, and feeling more and more disconnected from myself.

### ID: p44-7
After college, I moved to New York City and started working in finance. The high-pressure environment and long hours fueled my addiction. I was drinking and using drugs daily, but I convinced myself that I deserved it because I worked so hard. I was surrounded by colleagues who partied just as hard as they worked, so my behavior seemed normal.

### ID: p44-8
Over time, my addiction progressed. I started using cocaine regularly and would stay up all night partying and then go straight to work the next morning. I was living in a constant state of exhaustion and anxiety. I was having panic attacks and was struggling to keep up with the demands of my job.

### ID: p44-9
When I was twenty-eight, I had a breakdown at work. I was having a panic attack and couldn't stop crying. My boss sent me home and suggested I take some time off. I knew something had to change.

### ID: p44-10
I started seeing a therapist who specialized in trauma. Through therapy, I began to address the sexual abuse I had experienced as a child. This was incredibly painful, but it was also necessary for my healing. I also began to see the connection between my trauma and my addiction.

### ID: p44-11
My therapist suggested I try meditation as a way to manage my anxiety. I was skeptical, but I was willing to try anything. I started with just five minutes a day, and gradually increased my practice. I found that meditation helped me to feel more grounded and present. It gave me a way to be with my emotions without needing to numb them with drugs or alcohol.

### ID: p44-12
I also got involved in a recovery program. I started attending meetings and found a sponsor. I worked the steps and began to understand the nature of my addiction. I learned that I was not alone and that recovery was possible.

## Chapter 45: Destiny

### ID: p45-1

### ID: p45-2

### ID: p45-5
Over the next several years, I was in and out of jail. I was arrested for drug possession, assault, and theft. Each time I got out, I would promise myself and my mother that I would change, but I always went back to the same lifestyle. I didn't know any other way to live.

### ID: p45-6
When I was twenty-three, I got pregnant. I thought that having a baby would give me a reason to change my life. But after my daughter was born, I continued to use drugs and alcohol. I couldn't stop, even though I knew I was putting my daughter at risk.

## Chapter 46: Ned

### ID: p46-1
I grew up in a military family and moved around a lot as a child. My father was strict and had high expectations for me and my siblings. I learned early on that showing emotion was a sign of weakness, so I learned to suppress my feelings.

### ID: p46-2
When I was eighteen, I joined the military like my father. I served for eight years, including two tours in Iraq. During my time in the military, I witnessed and experienced traumatic events that would haunt me for years to come.

### ID: p46-3
While I was deployed, I started drinking alcohol as a way to cope with the stress and trauma. Many of my fellow soldiers drank heavily, so it seemed like a normal way to deal with what we were going through. I didn't realize at the time that I was developing a dependence on alcohol.

### ID: p46-4
When I returned home from my second deployment, I was struggling with PTSD. I was having nightmares, flashbacks, and severe anxiety. I couldn't sleep and was constantly on edge. I felt disconnected from my family and friends and had a hard time relating to civilian life.

### ID: p46-5
I continued to drink heavily as a way to cope with my symptoms. I was also prescribed pain medication for injuries I sustained during my service, and I quickly became dependent on the pills as well. I was using alcohol and pills daily, and my life was spiraling out of control.

## Chapter 47: Kara

### ID: p47-1
I grew up in a small town in the South. My family was very religious, and I was raised in a strict Christian household. My parents had very rigid beliefs about how I should behave and who I should be. I learned early on that I needed to conform to their expectations in order to be accepted.

### ID: p47-2
Despite my best efforts to be the perfect daughter, I always felt like something was wrong with me. I was different from the other kids and didn't fit in. I was very sensitive and took things to heart. I also struggled with my body image and developed an eating disorder in middle school.

### ID: p47-3
When I was fifteen, I was introduced to alcohol at a friend's house. I loved the way it made me feel. For the first time, I felt relaxed and comfortable in my own skin. I started drinking regularly and also began experimenting with diet pills and other drugs to control my weight.

### ID: p47-4
Throughout high school, I maintained good grades and was involved in church activities. On the outside, I appeared to be a model student and devoted Christian. But on the inside, I was struggling with my eating disorder, my drinking, and growing questions about my faith.

### ID: p47-5
When I went away to college, I was finally free from my parents' watchful eyes. I went wild. I was drinking heavily, using drugs, and engaging in risky sexual behaviors. I was also restricting my eating and exercising compulsively. I was out of control but didn't care.

### ID: p47-6
After college, I moved to a big city and tried to build a life for myself. I got a job in marketing and appeared to be successful. But behind closed doors, I was a mess. I was binge drinking every night, using cocaine on the weekends, and my eating disorder was worse than ever.

### ID: p47-7
I was also struggling with my faith. I had left the church because I no longer believed what I had been taught growing up. But I felt lost without a spiritual foundation. I was searching for meaning and purpose but didn't know where to find it.

### ID: p47-8
When I was twenty-eight, I collapsed at work from malnutrition and dehydration. I was rushed to the hospital, and the doctors told me that if I didn't get help for my eating disorder and addiction, I would die. This was my wake-up call.

### ID: p47-9
I entered a treatment program that specialized in co-occurring disorders. In treatment, I worked with a team of professionals who helped me address both my eating disorder and my addiction. I also began to explore my spiritual beliefs and what felt true for me.

### ID: p47-10
In treatment, I was introduced to Buddhism and meditation. I was drawn to these practices because they didn't require me to believe in a specific God or follow rigid rules. Instead, they offered me tools to understand my own mind and to find peace within myself.

### ID: p47-11
I began practicing meditation daily and studying Buddhist philosophy. I learned about the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path. I learned about impermanence, suffering, and the possibility of liberation. These teachings resonated with me in a way that nothing else ever had.

Today, I am grateful for my recovery and for the life I have been given. I work as a nutritionist and specialize in helping people with eating disorders. I also facilitate a Recovery Dharma meeting for people with eating disorders and body image issues. Helping others find freedom from these struggles gives my life purpose.

### ID: p47-15
The practices of Recovery Dharma have been essential to my recovery. Meditation helps me to stay present and to manage difficult emotions.

I am grateful to be part of this community and to have found a spiritual path that works for me.

## Chapter 48: Jean

### ID: p48-1
I am a seventy-two-year-old woman, and I have been in recovery for ten years. For most of my adult life, I was a functional alcoholic. I drank wine every evening, and over the years, the amount I drank steadily increased. I convinced myself that I didn't have a problem because I never drank in the morning, I never missed work, and I took care of my family.

### ID: p48-2
I grew up in the 1950s and 60s in a time when women were expected to be wives and mothers above all else. I got married right out of high school and had three children by the time I was twenty-five. I loved my children, but I also felt trapped and unfulfilled.

### ID: p48-3
My husband was a good provider but was emotionally distant. We rarely talked about anything meaningful, and I felt very alone in my marriage. I started drinking wine in the evenings as a way to relax and to cope with my loneliness and disappointment.

### ID: p48-4
Over the years, my drinking increased. I was drinking a bottle or two of wine every night. My children grew up and moved away, and I was left alone with my husband in a loveless marriage. I felt like my life had no purpose, and the wine helped me to numb those feelings.

### ID: p48-5
When I was sixty-two, my husband passed away suddenly from a heart attack. I was shocked and devastated. Even though our marriage wasn't happy, he had been my companion for over forty years. I didn't know how to live without him.

### ID: p48-6
After my husband died, my drinking spiraled out of control. I was drinking from morning until night. I stopped seeing friends and family. I stopped taking care of myself. I was severely depressed and didn't want to live anymore.

### ID: p48-7
My daughter became worried about me and came to visit. She was horrified by what she found. I was living in squalor, surrounded by empty wine bottles. She convinced me to go to the doctor, and I was diagnosed with alcohol use disorder and depression.

### ID: p48-8
My daughter helped me to find a treatment program. I was terrified. I had been drinking for over forty years and couldn't imagine life without alcohol. But I also knew that I couldn't continue living the way I was.

### ID: p48-9
In treatment, I was the oldest person in the program. I felt out of place and embarrassed. But the counselors and other participants were kind and welcoming. I began to see that addiction doesn't discriminate based on age, gender, or any other factor.

### ID: p48-10
In treatment, I was introduced to meditation. I had never meditated before and thought it would be impossible for me to quiet my mind. But with practice, I began to find moments of peace. I began to see that my thoughts were not facts and that I had a choice in how I responded to them.

### ID: p48-11
After leaving treatment, I got involved in a recovery program. I also started attending a Recovery Dharma meeting that met at a local meditation center. I was drawn to the Buddhist approach because it emphasized wisdom and compassion rather than punishment and shame.

### ID: p48-12
Through recovery, I have discovered who I am outside of being a wife and mother. I have developed interests and hobbies that bring me joy. I have made new friends in the recovery community. I have learned to be comfortable being alone without needing to numb myself with alcohol.

### ID: p48-13
Today, at seventy-two, I am happier than I have ever been. I have a daily meditation practice and attend Recovery Dharma meetings regularly. I also volunteer at a senior center and help other older adults who are struggling with addiction. It's never too late to change your life.

### ID: p48-14
The practices of Recovery Dharma have given me tools to navigate the challenges of aging. Meditation helps me to stay present and to accept the changes in my body and mind. The teachings on impermanence help me to let go of the past and to embrace each moment. The community gives me connection and support. I am grateful to have found this path in the later years of my life.

## Chapter 49: Unity

### ID: p49-1
I am a transgender woman, and my recovery journey is intertwined with my journey of discovering and embracing my true gender identity. Growing up, I knew that I was different, but I didn't have the language or understanding to explain what I was feeling. I was assigned male at birth, but I never felt like a boy.

### ID: p49-2
I grew up in a conservative family in a small town. There was no room for difference or deviation from the norm. I learned to hide who I truly was and to present as the boy that everyone expected me to be. But inside, I was dying.

### ID: p49-3
When I was a teenager, I started drinking alcohol and using drugs as a way to cope with the pain of living a lie. The substances helped me to numb my feelings and to dissociate from my body, which felt so wrong to me.

### ID: p49-4
I continued to use drugs and alcohol throughout my twenties and thirties. I got married to a woman and tried to live a "normal" life, but I was miserable. I was living a double life, secretly exploring my gender identity online and in private, while presenting as a cisgender man to the world.

### ID: p49-5
My addiction progressed, and I started using methamphetamine. The drug gave me a sense of euphoria and confidence that I had never experienced before. But it also led to dangerous and risky behaviors. I was putting my health and safety at risk.

### ID: p49-6
When I was forty, my wife discovered my secret. She was shocked and hurt, and our marriage ended. I was devastated but also relieved. I could no longer live a lie. I decided that I needed to come out as transgender and begin my transition.

### ID: p49-7
Coming out was one of the hardest and scariest things I have ever done. I lost many friends and family members who couldn't accept me. But I also found a community of transgender people who understood what I was going through and who supported me.

### ID: p49-8
Despite beginning my transition, I continued to struggle with addiction. In fact, my drug use intensified. I was using methamphetamine daily and my health was deteriorating. I knew I needed help, but I was afraid to go to treatment because I didn't know if I would be accepted as a transgender woman.

### ID: p49-9
I finally reached out to an LGBTQ+ community center, and they helped me find a treatment program that was welcoming and affirming of transgender individuals. Entering treatment was terrifying, but it was also the best decision I ever made.

### ID: p49-10
In treatment, I was able to be myself fully for the first time. I was addressed by my chosen name and pronouns. I was treated with dignity and respect. I began to heal from both my addiction and the trauma of living in hiding for so many years.

### ID: p49-11
I was introduced to meditation and mindfulness practices in treatment. These practices helped me to be present in my body, which had always been a source of pain for me. Through meditation, I began to develop a sense of acceptance and even appreciation for my body.

### ID: p49-12
After leaving treatment, I got involved in Recovery Dharma. I found a meeting that was specifically for LGBTQ+ individuals, and I felt at home. I was surrounded by people who understood the unique challenges of being queer and in recovery.

### ID: p49-13
Through recovery, I have continued my transition. I have been on hormone replacement therapy for five years, and I recently had gender confirmation surgery. I am finally living as my authentic self, and it feels incredible.

### ID: p49-14
Recovery has also given me a sense of purpose. I work as a peer support specialist for transgender individuals who are struggling with addiction. I want to help others know that they are not alone and that recovery is possible, no matter who you are.

### ID: p49-15
Today, I am grateful for my recovery and for the courage to live my truth. I am grateful for the LGBTQ+ community and for Recovery Dharma. The practices of meditation, mindfulness, and the Four Noble Truths have been essential to my healing. I am proud of who I am and the journey I have taken to get here.

## Chapter 50: Randall

### ID: p50-1
I am an African American man who grew up in the projects in a major city. My neighborhood was plagued by poverty, violence, and drugs. I witnessed my first shooting when I was six years old. I saw my first dead body when I was eight. This was my normal.

### ID: p50-2
My mother did her best to raise me and my three siblings on her own. My father was in and out of prison for most of my childhood. We didn't have much, but my mother always made sure we had food on the table and a roof over our heads.

### ID: p50-3
When I was ten, I started running errands for drug dealers in the neighborhood. They would give me money and drugs in exchange for delivering packages. This was how I was introduced to the drug trade and to using drugs myself.

### ID: p50-4
By the time I was a teenager, I was selling drugs and using regularly. I was using marijuana, cocaine, and whatever else I could get my hands on. I dropped out of school in ninth grade and was fully immersed in street life.

### ID: p50-5
Over the next twenty years, I was in and out of prison. I was arrested for drug possession, distribution, assault, and weapons charges. Each time I got out of prison, I would go right back to the same lifestyle. I didn't know any other way to live, and I didn't think there was any other option for someone like me.

### ID: p50-6
When I was thirty-five, I was incarcerated for the fifth time. This time, I was sentenced to ten years. I was angry and hopeless. I felt like the system had failed me and that I had failed myself. I didn't see any point in trying to change.

### ID: p50-7
While in prison, I met an older inmate who had turned his life around. He was different from the other guys – he was calm, centered, and seemed to have a sense of peace. I was curious about him and started talking to him.

### ID: p50-8
He told me about meditation and Buddhism. He explained that these practices had helped him to find freedom even while being incarcerated. He invited me to join a meditation group that met weekly in the prison. I was skeptical, but I decided to give it a try.

### ID: p50-9
Meditation was hard at first. My mind was racing, and I couldn't sit still. But the older inmate encouraged me to keep practicing. He told me that meditation wasn't about stopping my thoughts, but about observing them without judgment.

### ID: p50-10
Over time, I began to experience the benefits of meditation. I felt calmer and more in control of my emotions. I started to see my thoughts and beliefs more clearly. I began to question the narrative I had been telling myself – that I was a product of my environment and that I had no choice in who I became.

### ID: p50-11
I also started reading books about Buddhism and recovery. I learned about the Four Noble Truths and the concept that suffering is caused by our attachment and aversion. I began to see how my addiction and criminal behavior were rooted in suffering and how I could make different choices.

### ID: p50-12
When I was released from prison after serving seven years, I was determined to live differently. I got involved in a reentry program that helped me find housing and employment. I also started attending Recovery Dharma meetings.

### ID: p50-13
Recovery has not been easy. I have faced many challenges, including discrimination, lack of opportunities, and the pull to return to my old life. But I have stayed committed to my recovery and to my meditation practice.

### ID: p50-14
Today, I have been out of prison for three years and have been clean and sober the entire time. I work as a community organizer, advocating for criminal justice reform and supporting others who are reentering society after incarceration. I also facilitate a Recovery Dharma meeting in my community.

### ID: p50-15
The practices of Recovery Dharma have been essential to my recovery and to my ability to break free from the cycle of incarceration. Meditation has given me tools to manage my anger and to respond to challenges with wisdom rather than reactivity. The Buddhist teachings have helped me to see that I am not defined by my past and that I have the power to create a different future.

### ID: p50-16
I am grateful for my recovery and for the opportunity to give back to my community. I want to show young people in my neighborhood that there is another way to live and that change is possible. Recovery has given me hope and a sense of purpose that I never thought was possible for someone like me.

## Chapter 51: Lacey

### ID: p51-1
I am a mother of two beautiful children, and I am in recovery from opioid addiction. My addiction started with a legitimate prescription for pain medication after I was injured in a car accident. I was prescribed OxyContin for my back pain, and I took it as directed.

### ID: p51-2
At first, the medication helped with my pain and allowed me to function. But over time, I developed a tolerance and needed more and more to get the same effect. My doctor became concerned about my usage and cut me off. I was in pain and going through withdrawal, and I didn't know what to do.

### ID: p51-3
A friend told me that I could buy pills on the street, so I started doing that. I was spending all of my money on pills and was constantly worried about where I would get my next dose. My life became consumed by my addiction.

### ID: p51-4
When pills became too expensive and hard to find, someone suggested I try heroin. I was horrified at first. I had always thought of heroin users as bad people, and I didn't see myself that way. But I was desperate, and I tried it. This was the beginning of a nightmare.

### ID: p51-5
My heroin addiction progressed quickly. I was using multiple times a day and was constantly chasing the high. I neglected my children and my responsibilities. I lost my job and my home. My family was devastated and didn't know how to help me.

### ID: p51-6
Child Protective Services became involved, and my children were taken away from me and placed with my parents. This was the most painful experience of my life. I loved my children more than anything, but I couldn't stop using. My addiction had complete control over me.

### ID: p51-7
I tried to get clean on my own multiple times, but I would go through terrible withdrawal symptoms and would always relapse. I overdosed three times and nearly died each time. I felt hopeless and didn't think I would ever be able to get my life back.

### ID: p51-8
After my third overdose, I was hospitalized and a social worker came to see me. She told me about a medication-assisted treatment program that could help me. I was desperate and willing to try anything.

### ID: p51-9
I entered the program and was started on Suboxone, a medication that helps to reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms. This medication saved my life. For the first time in years, I was able to function without being consumed by my addiction.

### ID: p51-10
The program also included counseling and group therapy. I worked with a therapist to address the underlying issues that contributed to my addiction, including trauma from my car accident and struggles with anxiety and depression.

### ID: p51-11
I was also introduced to meditation and mindfulness practices. These practices helped me to manage my cravings and to be present with my emotions without needing to use. I learned to observe my thoughts and to create space between my urges and my actions.

### ID: p51-12
After six months in the program, I was granted supervised visitation with my children. Seeing them again was both joyful and painful. I had missed so much of their lives, and they were scared and unsure of me. I was determined to earn back their trust and to be the mother they deserved.

### ID: p51-13
I continued to work my recovery program and attend therapy. I also got involved in Recovery Dharma and found a community of people who supported me. I worked hard to rebuild my life and to prove to the courts that I was capable of caring for my children.

### ID: p51-14
After a year, I regained full custody of my children. This was the happiest day of my life. I promised them and myself that I would never let addiction come between us again.

### ID: p51-15
Today, I have been in recovery for four years. I am still on medication-assisted treatment, and I am grateful for it. I have a stable home, a job, and most importantly, I have my children. I am present for them in ways I never was before.

### ID: p51-16
I am also giving back by helping other mothers who are struggling with opioid addiction. I volunteer with a peer support program and share my story to give hope to others. I want people to know that recovery is possible and that medication-assisted treatment is a valid and effective form of treatment.

### ID: p51-17
The practices of Recovery Dharma have been an important part of my recovery. Meditation helps me to stay grounded and to manage difficult emotions. The teachings on compassion have helped me to forgive myself for the pain I caused my children and my family. The community has shown me that I am not alone. I am grateful for this path and for the life I have been given.

## Chapter 52: Paul

### ID: p52-1
I am a fifty-five-year-old man, and I have been in recovery for fifteen years. For most of my adult life, I was a high-functioning alcoholic. I had a successful career as a lawyer, a beautiful home, and a loving family. On the outside, I appeared to have it all. But on the inside, I was struggling with a secret addiction to alcohol.

### ID: p52-2
I started drinking in college, like many of my peers. But unlike my friends who could have a few drinks and stop, I couldn't. Once I started drinking, I couldn't control how much I drank. This pattern continued throughout my twenties and thirties.

### ID: p52-3
I managed to build a successful career despite my drinking. I was a partner at a prestigious law firm and was respected by my colleagues. I convinced myself that I didn't have a problem because I was successful and was providing for my family.

### ID: p52-4
But the truth was that my drinking was affecting every aspect of my life. I was emotionally unavailable to my wife and children. I missed important events because I was too drunk to attend. I was irritable and angry when I wasn't drinking.

### ID: p52-5
My wife confronted me multiple times about my drinking, but I denied that I had a problem. I told her that I was just unwinding after stressful days at work. I made excuses and blamed her for nagging me.

### ID: p52-6
When I was forty, I got a DUI. I was driving home from a business dinner and was pulled over. I was arrested and spent the night in jail. This was humiliating and terrifying. I was worried about how this would affect my career and my reputation.

### ID: p52-7
My wife gave me an ultimatum – get help or she would leave. I didn't want to lose my family, so I agreed to go to treatment. But I wasn't ready to fully commit to recovery. I went through the motions but didn't really believe I had a problem.

### ID: p52-8
After treatment, I stayed sober for a few months, but then I started drinking again. I convinced myself that I could control it this time. But within weeks, I was drinking just as much as before.

### ID: p52-9
Over the next few years, my drinking got worse. I started drinking in the mornings to stop the shakes. I was hiding alcohol in my office and drinking throughout the day. My work performance suffered, and I was eventually asked to resign from the law firm.

### ID: p52-10
Losing my career was devastating. I felt like a failure. My identity had been wrapped up in being a successful lawyer, and now I had nothing. My wife finally left and took our children with her. I had lost everything.

### ID: p52-11
I hit rock bottom and knew that I needed to get serious about recovery or I was going to die. I entered treatment again, but this time I was willing to do whatever it took to get sober.

### ID: p52-12
In treatment, I worked with a therapist to address the underlying issues that contributed to my alcoholism, including perfectionism, workaholism, and a deep fear of failure. I also learned about the disease of addiction and how my brain chemistry had been altered by years of heavy drinking.

### ID: p52-13
I was introduced to meditation in treatment, and it became a cornerstone of my recovery. Through meditation, I learned to be present with uncomfortable emotions rather than numbing them with alcohol. I learned to observe my thoughts without getting caught up in them. I learned to be kind to myself.

### ID: p52-14
After leaving treatment, I got involved in both a Twelve Step program and Recovery Dharma. I found that the combination of these approaches worked well for me. I worked the Twelve Steps with a sponsor and also developed a daily meditation practice.

### ID: p52-15
Recovery has been a journey of humility and self-discovery. I have had to let go of my ego and my need to appear perfect. I have had to accept responsibility for the pain I caused my family. I have had to rebuild my life from the ground up.

### ID: p52-16
Today, I am grateful for my recovery. I have rebuilt my relationship with my children, although my marriage did not survive. I have a new career as a counselor, helping others who are struggling with addiction. This work is far more fulfilling than my work as a lawyer ever was.

### ID: p52-17
I have a daily spiritual practice that includes meditation, reading, and attending meetings. I also facilitate a Recovery Dharma meeting and sponsor other men in recovery. Helping others is a key part of my recovery and gives my life meaning.

### ID: p52-18
The practices of Recovery Dharma have deepened my recovery in profound ways. Meditation has helped me to stay present and to manage stress without turning to alcohol. The teachings on impermanence have helped me to let go of my attachment to outcomes. The practice of compassion has helped me to forgive myself and others. I am grateful to be part of this community and for the tools that support my ongoing recovery.

## Chapter 53: Eunsung

### ID: p53-1
I grew up in South Korea in a culture where there is a lot of shame around mental health issues and addiction. My family valued education and success above all else, and there was immense pressure to excel academically and professionally.

### ID: p53-2
I was a good student and worked hard to meet my parents' expectations. I got into a prestigious university and studied engineering. But I was struggling with severe anxiety and depression. I felt like I was carrying a heavy weight on my shoulders all the time.

### ID: p53-3
In university, I was introduced to alcohol. Drinking is a big part of Korean culture, especially among students and businesspeople. I quickly discovered that alcohol helped me to relax and to feel more comfortable in social situations.

### ID: p53-4
After graduating, I got a job at a large corporation. The work culture was intense – long hours, high pressure, and heavy drinking. It was expected that employees would go out drinking with colleagues and bosses after work. This was where business relationships were built.

### ID: p53-5
My drinking increased dramatically. I was drinking every night after work and on weekends. I was also drinking alone at home to cope with my anxiety and depression. I knew my drinking was becoming a problem, but I didn't know how to stop. There was also so much shame around admitting I had a problem.

### ID: p53-6
When I was thirty, I immigrated to the United States for a job opportunity. I thought that moving to a new country would give me a fresh start and that I would be able to control my drinking. But I brought my problems with me.

### ID: p53-7
In the U.S., I felt isolated and lonely. I didn't have the same social network that I had in Korea. I struggled with the language and cultural differences. I turned to alcohol more and more to cope with these feelings.

### ID: p53-8
My drinking spiraled out of control. I was drinking from morning until night. I lost my job and my apartment. I was homeless for a period of time. I felt like I had failed my family and myself. The shame was overwhelming.

### ID: p53-9
I was too ashamed to reach out to my family or friends for help. I felt like I had to handle this on my own. I tried to quit drinking many times, but I always relapsed. I didn't know where to turn.

### ID: p53-10
One day, I was at a public library trying to stay warm, and I saw a flyer for a Recovery Dharma meeting. I was curious because I had been raised Buddhist in Korea, although I hadn't practiced in many years. I decided to attend the meeting.

### ID: p53-11
At my first meeting, I was nervous and didn't speak much. But I listened to others share their stories, and I felt less alone. I realized that addiction doesn't discriminate and that people from all walks of life struggle with this disease.

### ID: p53-12
I kept coming back to meetings and eventually got a sponsor. I started practicing meditation again, which I had learned as a child. The meditation practice helped me to reconnect with myself and to find some inner peace.

### ID: p53-13
Through recovery, I also began to address my anxiety and depression. I started seeing a therapist who specialized in working with Asian Americans. This was important because she understood the cultural context of my struggles and the specific challenges I faced.

### ID: p53-14
I learned that in Korean culture, there is a lot of stigma around mental health and addiction. People are expected to be strong and to handle their problems on their own. Asking for help is seen as a sign of weakness. Working with a culturally competent therapist helped me to challenge these beliefs.

### ID: p53-15
Recovery has been a journey of healing not just from addiction, but also from the cultural shame and expectations that contributed to my suffering. I have learned that asking for help is actually a sign of strength. I have learned to be compassionate with myself.

### ID: p53-16
Today, I have been in recovery for five years. I have rebuilt my life and have a job that I enjoy. I have also reconnected with my family in Korea and have been honest with them about my struggles. They have been more supportive than I expected.

### ID: p53-17
I am involved in the Korean American community and am working to reduce the stigma around mental health and addiction. I facilitate a Recovery Dharma meeting in Korean for Korean speakers who are struggling with addiction. Many people in the community have told me how grateful they are to have a recovery space in their own language.

### ID: p53-18
The practices of Recovery Dharma have been essential to my recovery. Meditation helps me to manage my anxiety and to stay present. The Buddhist teachings resonate with me because they are part of my cultural heritage. The community has shown me that I am not alone and that recovery is possible for everyone, regardless of background.

### ID: p53-19
I am grateful for my recovery and for the opportunity to help others in my community. Recovery has given me a sense of purpose and connection that I never had before. I am proof that it is never too late to change your life and that there is hope, even in the darkest times.
