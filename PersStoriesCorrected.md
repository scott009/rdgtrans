## Chapter 40: Amy
### ID: p40-1
Like so many of us, I grew up never being taught what to do with my feelings, raised by parents who were never taught what to do with theirs. And like so many of us, trauma scarred my young life. I experienced those traumas alone, with no tools except the ability to compartmentalize my feelings and fragment myself. It is no surprise that when I discovered drugs and alcohol at the age of thirteen, it felt like an epiphany. Here was the perfect way to run from myself, to numb my pain, to create what felt like a safe little world all my own where no one could touch me. And even when they did touch me, I couldn’t feel it.

### ID: p40-4
Right from the start, I loved using alone. That was my preferred
way of getting high, although of course I also did it socially. I would also
get high secretly and not tell anyone, sitting there surrounded by people,
feeling like a ghost. But what I loved most was sitting in my room by
myself, convincing myself that this place I created inside my head was the
real world, and the one outside, the one full of people and pain, was just
an illusion.
### ID: p40-3
The first time I went to rehab, I was sixteen, driven by a depression that no amount of drugs seemed to improve. I wanted it to work,
and I approached sobriety like the straight-A student I was. But after a
year and a half, I was lonelier than ever, and I convinced myself that I
could drink and use like a normal person. Not even two years later, I
dropped out of my dream college, addicted to cocaine, suffering severe
mental health issues, and wanting to die.
### ID: p40-4
By the time I finally got sober at age twenty-eight. I had spent
years eking out alife despite myself. I hit a few bottoms on my way there,
but somehow I ended up with a promising career, a nice partner, and a
house. As always, I lived a double life, my troubled inner world hidden
by my armor of privilege and accomplishment. But I was so tired. I had
tried in vain for years to control my drinking and drug use, doing all the
things we do to lie to ourselves. I managed to quit drugs, but I would
always drink again, not knowing what else to do with the feelings that
would inevitably come up, the discomfort I had no idea how to sit with.
### ID: p40-5
I went to rehab again and threw myself into AA. I was lucky to
have gotten sober in the Bay Area, where the 12-step community was
diverse and progressive, where it was possible to find a cozy niche of
women’s and queer meetings that felt like home, where they didn’t say the
Lord’s prayer, and where their approach to the program and the Big Book 
was more trauma-informed and less dogmatic than many other places
### ID: p40-6
For the first time in my life, I felt like I found my people, and I
began finding myself. I learned how to be close to people. I learned how
to take responsibility for my actions, and I learned that my actions affec -
ed other people. Somehow, that had never occurred to me. I had been
so consumed by my own pain for so much of my life, in some way I had
started to believe I was the only one who felt anything.
### ID: p40-7
I had a good early recovery in 12-steps, and I am grateful. In my
first few years, I also started exploring Buddhism, going to a day-long
retreat and a few meditation groups here and there, reading everything I
could find about a Buddhist approach to the 12-steps. I thought I, and
my program, were invincible. At five years sober and a mother to an
almost one-year old, my partner and I decided we were done with city
living and moved across the country to the mountains of North Carolina.
I had always been good at moving, running from problem to problem
and starting over somewhere else. But this time, I wasn’t running from
something — or so I thought. My life in the Bay Area had been wonderful, but I was ready to start the next chapter of my life.
### ID: p40-8
Something was missing, and I thought I would find it in this
unfamiliar place surrounded by strangers.
But it didn’t go quite as planned. I had expected to just fall into
12-steps here and find a new friend group like I did back in California.
But the meetings were weird, full of a southern Christian God and what
seemed like questionable recovery. Theold-timers sounded like cult leaders. The repetition of readings and sayings and slogans began to wear
thin. With the stress of a young child and a huge life transition, and without the community we had back in the Bay, the cracks in my marriage also started to show. I was lonely in North Carolina, and the foundation of both my recovery and my personal life was starting to feel shaky

### ID: p40-10
Then I found a flier on a coffee shop bulletin board for a Buddhist recovery group, and I decided to give it a try. Themeeting was just a handful of quirky-looking people sitting on cushions in a circle on the floor, talking about their lives in what felt like a refreshingly intimate and authentic way. I immediately felt like this was the room I wanted to be in.
### ID: p40-11
Over the next several months, I found a home in this new community. I began to see my personal growth with a Buddhist lens, addiction as something much deeper than a dependency on chemicals or even
a disease. Yearning was the human condition, and we addicts, through
whatever concoction of trauma and adverse childhood experiences and 
hereditary influences, came to feel these yearnings more intensely, often
for things beyond substances. Buddhism deepened my recovery in ways
I never imagined possible in 12-steps, inviting me to not only look outward at systems created by others, but ultimately look inward and trust my own wisdom.

### ID: p40-12
That is not to say I think I know all the answers. I certainly knew
very little about how to live an honest and healthy life when I got sober,
and I needed to look outward for wisdom, to trusted groups and people
who I knew had something valuable to teach me. I believe being humble
is essential to wisdom. But as my recovery deepens, so does my trust of
my ability to make healthy choices — and to also know when I need help
figuring out what those healthy choices are.
### ID: p40-13
It is easy for me to focus solely on the inward-looking aspects of
Buddhism and convince myself sometimes that this is a solitary path. But
there is a reason sangha is one of the three jewels at the core of this path,
and I know I cannot do this alone.
### ID: p40-14
It is easy for me to make Buddhism complicated, to over-intellectualize, but I also know that I feel most grounded when I focus on
just being with experience rather than judging or analyzing it. When in
doubt, I remind myself of the core teaching: do no harm. I remind myself
that includes not doing harm to myself.
### ID: p40-15
Buddhist recovery has taught me the importance of being kind
and gentle to myself. It has taught me to look at my intentions and motivations for doing things. It has helped me understand that I can find
peace regardless of what is happening outside of myself, and that I do not
need external validation to feel that I am enough. And I am finding that
the more I feel that I am enough, the less I crave other things to fill me up.
### ID: p40-16
When we started Recovery Dharma, one of our core intentions
was to emphasize that this is a program of empowerment, not powerlessness. Acceptance of what is is part of equanimity and integral to our liberation, but that is not the same as powerlessness. As a writer, I know that
words matter. As a survivor of trauma among so many other survivors of
trauma, I know that powerlessness is not what I want my recovery to be
based on. Instead, I see my recovery as a path towards wholeness and
embodied, empowered choices.
### ID: p40-17
I may not always have power over what happens in the world,
what happens to me, or even my own feelings, but I have power in how I
choose to respond. Sometimes that power is limited by old patterns and
trauma response, but it is still there. My Buddha nature, my liberation,
is always inside me, always accessible. I have the power to be kind and
gentle to myself and others. I have the power to set boundaries, and also
to forgive. I have the power to look at my various human yearnings and
discern what is motivated by craving versus what is motivated by curiosity, connection, and joy. I have the power to be present and breathe
through whatever life brings me, and to be grateful for all of it.

## Chapter 41: Chance

### ID: p41-1
Dharma, sobriety, and my identity are delightfully blended. The pivotal push to getting sober was a feeling of disconnection from my chosen family, and from myself. An occasionally deep, often mild, haunting sensation of hindered intimacy. I wanted to show up and be truly me, meeting truly them, but there was always this cloudy curtain between us.

### ID: p41-2
When I was eleven, I started with alcohol, and my mom was one of those "as long as it's at home, substance use is okay" kind of parents. I was eleven and a lot of my friends were sixteen, so you know we were drinking and driving, and then soon added pot, and acid, and mushrooms. I grew up in rural Ohio, and nature was a big part of my experience as a teen. We talked like we thought the substances brought us closer to nature and its beauty and mystery, but probably we would have gotten closer to the elements had we been sober and actually present. Either way, I was able to escape home and two parents who didn't talk, slept in separate beds, and yet supposedly were staying together for me, by zipping off and flying high with my crew. I also did a lot of drugs with my mom. She introduced me to cocaine, meth, and crack. Our shared dependence was a distorted parent-child closeness. She was, and still is, hurt and lonely.

### ID: p41-3
I excelled in my tiny Catholic high school. I was a perfectionist, took all the advanced classes, skipped a grade in French, wrote for the newspaper, pushed vegetarianism. I eventually graduated as the valedictorian. I'd jam all my homework during lunch time so that I'd be free to check out as fully as possible from after school until bedtime with drugs. And that was the cycle, day after day.

### ID: p41-4
My queerness emerged early on. In 6th grade, I famously declared, "When I grow up, I'm going to be bisexual." Which to this day, I'm fully embodying. However, in small town, sex-negative USA, this was easier said than done. When I became (at that time) a girl kissing girls, the hang ups and harassing phone calls to our house line started happening. I never denied my desires or who I am, and I paid for it, but I never considered another way to be. I had a high school girlfriend when I was in 8th grade, and we partied and learned bodies.

### ID: p41-5
College and grad school were more of the same. Me working so hard and then rewarding myself at the end of the day and fuzzing out. More and more special people came into my life, through queer, activist, and academic communities. I love relationship building, exploring, navigating, co-finding channels for growth and creativity. Yet I felt the channels were blocked, and separation was apparent.

### ID: p41-6
In Fall 2012, I decided my drinking was out of control. I had never really liked alcohol. Both of my parents were alcoholics and addicts, and I just couldn't be like them. So I cut out the alcohol, because I thought that was the problem. Things definitely felt less chaotic, and my body felt better. But the drugs continued - so much marijuana daily, plus MDMA and psychedelics often. The disconnection with my romantic partners was palpable, so I enacted a "sober sex only" policy for myself and my dates. I learned quite a bit about queerness, presence, and substances then. Many people couldn't easily set aside drinks and/or drugs in preparation for sex. These early negotiations around substances and physicality were significant. They were empowering, and I was able to practice directness and consent.

### ID: p41-7
Yet stopping at sober sex wasn't enough. After six months of the policy, the same six months on gender-affirmin hormone therapy, I went on a trip to Las Vegas with a sex worker collective I was part of, and — while I didn't know that it would be the last time — I took my last dose of drugs in the desert. The next day was my dad's birthday, not an uncomplicated date, and that became my sobriety anniversary.

### ID: p41-8
I stopped because I had had enough. On that desert walk in my altered state, alone but with others, I just thought about how I could get to so many of these same places with my meditation practice and so much less clinging and opacity. I was in the middle of a 90 and 90 meditation challenge I was doing with a dharma buddy, where we would meditate 90 minutes a day for 90 days. I was committed, and I was ready for change.

### ID: p41-9
Upon abstaining, I had a built-in network of sober friends from my meditation community, which held a lot of sober punks. At the same time, it felt like a magnificent shift and very organic. It was simple, but not easy. I lost friends. I broke up with most of my romantic relationships. A lot of people asking "WHY???" "You don't have a problem?" "You never seemed like things got out of control," etc., etc. This still happens, and I'm celebrating my ten-year soberversary.

### ID: p41-10
Getting sober required a lot of release. Staying sober requires doing all the ancillary work, in addition to being active in a recovery community. Dharma, sangha, honesty, connection, communication, compassion, rupture, repair… This one-line string of words and principles encapsulates an ever-challenging life practice of being a better person and causing less harm and bringing more joy into the world. I'm extremely grateful to be embedded in a community that can reflect back these values while we all stumble trustfully together.

### ID: p41-11
I am one of the stewards of our first NYC-area queer Recovery Dharma meeting, and it's truly magic. Queer and trans people healing together on this path, we especially need each other and this space where we can process shared experience and difficulties Service has always been a large part of my recovery. Whether I was an Intersangha Rep, or Events Chair organizing daylong retreats and my favorite — the New Year's Eve gathering, meeting chair, mentor/wise friend, meeting location finder and conduit…showing up, opening up, being an anchor, feeling anchored by others, and holding space is central to nourishing the group's collective health and continuation.

### ID: p41-12
I like this saying that I've heard from a few Dharma teachers, "Don't waste your suffering " For me, this points to the power of transformation in the Eightfold Path. It's especially supportive because it's not a consecutive sequence. To me, the Dharma is kaleidoscopic. Each little bit of the path catches and mirrors back countless other pieces of the path.

### ID: p41-13
I've spent a lot of time tuning into ethics (known as sīla in Pāli), the three stages along the Eightfold Path — right speech, right action, and right livelihood. Growing up, I received messages that it was okay to screw other people over to get ahead. This ethos ran deep, and I've had to, and continue to do a lot of undoing and behavioral remodeling work. I don't waste the suffering that can be transmuted when I am tempted to or act in an unskillful way and catch myself. I check how my body and heart feel, note it, and investigate those qualities. I also try not to beat myself up and instead practice self-compassion. And when I choose a skillful action, I feel into the gratitude and joy, how it emerges in my body, and I try to expand that.

### ID: p41-14
A big part of staying sober has also been handling loss. A couple years ago, my ex-partner died from addiction. They weren't only my ex-partner, but they were one of my strongest recovery inspirations when I was in early sobriety. Together we founded the group that would later become Recovery Dharma NYC. I am still taking advice they shared when we were in each other's lives. And I'm heartbroken that the pull of escaping with substances overpowered their ability to take one of their own pieces of advice that they gave me after they started using again, "It's much easier to stay sober than to get sober." They told me they struggled with presenting as trans feminine in the world while sober — the frequent affronts of harassment, rage, rudeness, and microaggressions were heavy to handle.

### ID: p41-15
As a trans (masculine) person, I have experienced much of this myself, and I know that transphobia is amplified against trans feminine people. I'm also grateful that myself and many other trans and gender diverse people have found continued strength and clarity in sobriety and support from our practices and networks to keep going.

### ID: p41-16
"I love you, keep going." This is a metta phrase that was passed down from a Dharma teacher years back, one that appears often in my reflections. I, like all beings, am deserving of love, including my own love. It all starts there. I will persist and resist the narratives and attacks against trans people. Especially in this time when there is an intensely targeted political attack on our existence.

### ID: p41-17
I am training to face reality, and to see it for what it is. Here are some snapshots of my practice. Everyday, I sit down to meditate. Maybe it's 45 minutes, or 5 minutes, or somewhere in between. I heard a teacher once say that even just paying attention to 1 breath counts. After I meditate, I recite the Five Remembrances, or listen to monks chanting them in a video online.

### ID: p41-18
I am of the nature to grow old, there is no escaping growing old. I am of the nature to get sick, there is no escaping sickness. I am of the nature to die, there is no escaping death. Everyone and everything I love are of the nature to change, and there is no escaping separation from them. My actions are my only belongings, I cannot escape their consequences, they are the ground upon which I stand.

### ID: p41-19
Next I recite one round of classic metta phrases. I close my sit with taking refuge in the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha.

### ID: p41-20
I build on my daily sitting and life practice with residential practice periods. I do at least one 7-10 day silent meditation retreat per year (this year I did my first metta retreat, and it was incredibly fruitful), plus spend a week at a Thai Forest Buddhist Monastery. I'm grateful for the opportunities for these extended, dedicated practice periods, and believe that they have contributed immensely to expanding and strengthening wisdom, balance, and heartfulness.

### ID: p41-21
I'm still continuing to identify impermanence (anicca), ungovernability (anatta), and unsatisfactoriness (dukkha) and the ways in which I relate to them, and I don't doubt that these will be lifelong tasks. But I'm seeing them a lot more, and clearer, and this naturally has made recovery more attainable, and intoxication much less desirable. Escaping doesn't lead to lasting happiness, in fact in my experience, it just prolongs and sometimes solidifies whatever I'm trying to get away from. The benefits of being in touch with these three marks of existence are many — increased appreciation and presence, awareness of the vast webs and chains of interdependence, and a letting be of things being what I want and how I want them. Recovery Dharma has kept me rooted and rejoicing.

You can read another iteration of my story in the Transcending: Trans Buddhist Voices anthology.

## Chapter 42: Synyi
Content Warning: Suicide

### ID: p42-1
I found Recovery Dharma during the lowest and most transformative time of my life. The popsicle sticks and glue that I used to contain my overwhelm and despair came crashing down around me. I'd later learn to refer to these popsicle sticks as substance use and process addictions, and that my overwhelm was rooted in untreated depression and trauma. Looking back on my recovery journey, I am grateful for the experience, learning, and healing, but it was hard-earned.

### ID: p42-2
My story starts in kindergarten, when I immigrated with my parents. Overnight, my world changed — a foreign place with a new language, knowing almost no one, a new school where I couldn't understand anybody, and my parents working all the time to survive. They did their best, but an asleep parent isn't a present parent, and I had to learn independence from a young age.

### ID: p42-3
I grew up seeing my parents model working hard, sacrificing their needs, acting strong, and never talking about feelings. I learned that my role in the family was to study hard, to not be a burden with my needs, push down my feelings, and that I needed to be happy so that their sacrifices were worth it.

### ID: p42-4
By high school, I'd been pushing down fears and insecurities for years. I was doing well in school, and that came with some self-worth and external validation, but I also felt so alone. The closer friendships I'd developed were always cut short by one of us moving away. So I entered high school with no real friends but luckily got adopted by an extrovert who I shared a geography class with.

### ID: p42-5
Finding some friends slowly built some confidence, but even in that circle, I felt like I was on the periphery, overthinking and worrying that I wasn't good enough, attractive enough, cool enough to have friends. But I got by, pushing down those insecurities. Later in high school, I found myself with people who had access to weed, and when I smoked, the incessant chatter in my mind cleared. I could be in on the secret and didn't have to worry about being uncool for once because everything was just hilarious instead.

### ID: p42-6
But when I was living my usual sober life as a straight-laced nerd, I was fraught with social anxiety and low self-esteem. The next times of my life were fueled by fear and external validation. I started to gain the external markers of success: I graduated top of my class, attracted romantic partners, got a coveted job, moved into a condo in the city. On the outside, things were great, but inside I was frightened constantly that the perfect facade would crack and everyone would see me as a fraud. I fell into coping mechanisms: working constantly and seeking perfection because if I was perfect then the fear of not being "good enough" felt a little less intense.

### ID: p42-7
On evenings to "treat myself" for the shitty life I put up with, I'd smoke weed from the moment I walked through the door until I eventually passed out in a smoke-filled oblivion, and every weekend was wake and bake. I was living only for the weekends, going to raves and festivals, taking party drugs and chasing the serotonin highs and feelings of connectedness that made me feel something other than the depression and anxiety that plagued my workdays. I started going to work high and my roommates and close friends started to tell me that they were worried about me. Honestly I was worried about me too.

### ID: p42-8
During a particularly stressful time at work, I went on vacation and came home wondering why I was staying in a job I hated. I'm fortunate that I had saved up some money, and so I quit without a job lined up and decided I was going to travel. Surely my location was the problem and if I traveled to beautiful destinations, then I would be happy. I was leaving on a trip to try to outrun my anxiety and depression, and maybe find some key to happiness because other solutions to stress, like mindfulness, hadn't worked for me.

### ID: p42-9
I now understand that with the unresolved trauma, my mind was a place that lacked self-compassion and my body felt unsafe when I sat still. It felt like such serendipity when I was struck by the idea that some people turn to religion in times of uncertainty and fear, so my desperation turned me to giving my parent's Buddhist religion a try. Up to this point, I had been an adamant atheist, though I always obeyed when my parents wanted me to go with them to the nearby Buddhist temple.

### ID: p42-10
I didn't understand why we lit incense, bowed three times in front of statues of deities I didn't recognize, and prayed with offerings for good things or for bad things not to happen. It all just seemed like illogical superstition to me. Now that I opened my mind to the idea of Buddhism, I learned about the Therada and Mahayana traditions in Southeast Asia, and they spoke to me so much more than my parents' practices. I searched online for a beginner intro to Buddhism and found Jetsunma Tenzin Palmo's book "Into the Heart of Life" and serendipitously again, her preface felt like it spoke directly to me as I was preparing for my trip. I highlighted a passage about how the mind is always with us, with its thoughts and fears from which we can never escape and so it makes sense to try and work with our mind so that it becomes a friendly travel companion for our journey through life.

### ID: p42-11
I dove into the book and became aware of the truth of impermanence and the truth of suffering. It resonated with me so deeply that the Buddha never demanded people to blindly follow his teachings, but instead encouraged them to observe for themselves and see that what he taught was true. And while impermanence and suffering made sense, I couldn't wrap my head around non-attachment or no-self, so I was determined to learn about it on my trip. That's how I ended up volunteering in Thailand, though I can't say I learned too much about these Buddhist concepts in Thailand because of the language barrier. However, I did meet some incredibly kind monks and laypeople.

### ID: p42-12
It was true though that no matter how far I went, my mind was always with me. It was telling me that I'm not good enough, that I'm weak since I burned out, and that I'm a broken depressed person who will never be happy if I couldn't even be perfectly happy while seeing these beautiful sights. I'm really glad to say that I have a much healthier relationship with my thoughts and emotions today with the help of lots of therapy, my recovery and Recovery Dharma, and my growing meditation practice.

### ID: p42-13
I eventually grew homesick and came home. I found a corporate job and started living with my now-spouse. We abused weed together every day, and as my job got more stressful, my weed use increased. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, I was a shell of a person, reclused into myself by overwhelm at work and even more overwhelm by basic things like going to the grocery store.

### ID: p42-14
I would later come to realize that the drastic shift in the world overnight as well as the panic about the unknown was emotionally triggering my trauma around immigrating at such a young age. I think I experienced emotional flashbacks of my terror and reverted to my kindergarten psychological capacity. Except this time, I had weed to abuse to try to quell the overwhelming panic. And it worked for a while, until it didn't anymore. I started down into the worst episode of depression I ever experienced — I lost interest in friends, hobbies, and my partner, and I shut down. It was really scary when I lost the ability to concentrate and my work performance declined, especially scary as someone whose self-worth came from work. As my overwhelm and terror grew, I turned to weed during the work day too and I hated myself for it. I entered a cycle of panic, using, feeling a few minutes of relief, and then hating myself for being weak for giving in to the craving.

### ID: p42-15
The height of my addiction, or my metaphorical bottom, came when I lost the will to live. My attempt on my life luckily ended with me in the emergency room. I was admitted to inpatient treatment and detoxed from marijuana while attending group therapy and learned the powerful feeling of connection when someone says "me too." I had started therapy about a year before, but because I was high all the time, I wasn't mindful of my thoughts and feelings outside of therapy sessions, so progress was slow. I left inpatient treatment with a waiting list spot for an outpatient program, a recommendation that I give up marijuana and attend psychologist follow-up sessions. I remember being told that depression was a three-pronged combination of bio, psycho, social, and that I would need to address bio with medication, psycho with therapy, and social by building up a mental well-being support system.

### ID: p42-16
For social support, I found my way to the rooms of Marijuana Anonymous where I heard other people telling stories that were similar to mine and it really helped me to stay off the weed. But the "singleness of purpose" tradition in 12-Step felt stifling because my problem wasn't only marijuana use, it was also the trauma I was unearthing in the "psycho" prong. Again I come back to serendipity. The Recovery Dharma program was exactly what I needed at the time. I received a suggestion to attend a second recovery meeting on a day that I had already been to an MA meeting, and curious, I went searching for alternatives.

### ID: p42-17
Through the Buddhist Recovery Network website, I found Recovery Dharma. When I visited the website, I was delighted to find that the Recovery Dharma book was readily available for free on the website, that it was accessible to me in my time of need. I devoured the book quickly — it helped me to frame my addiction in the teachings of the Buddha that I had already developed an interest in. Now revisiting the Dharma with my new lived experience of addiction, the truth of suffering took on new meaning.

### ID: p42-18
I found a sangha that met almost daily. And almost every day, I came and sat in meditation with like-minded travelers on the path. We could talk about anything, without the restrictions of "singleness of purpose." It was exactly what I needed because it helped me learn to meditate with the safety of a group, and I learned the language of talking about my trauma from reading the trauma-informed RD book, listening to shares, and practicing during my own shares.

### ID: p42-19
Today I feel like I'm thriving, not merely surviving. I've been sober from my "drug of no choice" for almost 3 years, and I've made great progress managing my process addictions of workaholism and perfectionism. I'm practicing real self love, gratitude, meditation, and validating my own feelings. My family, friends, and work are all going better than ever before. I can be present for my loved ones. I am able to take care of my darling cat and accept her love. I'm able to give back by hosting meetings in service of my sangha. I'm also blessed to be able to volunteer my professional skills as an RD Global Board Member and serve on Board committees.

### ID: p42-20
I have cultivated an understanding of myself, my trauma, triggers and coping mechanisms, so that I can weather the emotional storms when they come and give myself loving-kindness. There is hope and joy in my life, as well as strength and security in knowing that although I can't carpet the whole world, I can put on shoes as I continue my travels, with my healthier mind and spirit as my companion.
## Chapter 43: Matthew
Content Warning: Suicide

### ID: p43-1
One December morning, I made myself a cup of Folgers coffee and peered out the bars of my prison cell. My cellmate had gone to the yard and I had some time alone. Watching an armed guard walk past on the catwalk outside, I pondered life. "Why didn't anybody tell me it would hurt this much?" I asked myself. I was twenty-seven years old, recently sober, and barely two years into a fourteen year prison sentence. Things were actually getting better, though it was hard to see at the time.

### ID: p43-2
It hadn't always hurt that much. It had started out as fun. Growing up, there was always a case of cheap beer inside the fridge in the garage. It was there mostly for guests since neither of my parents really drank. I was eight years old the first time I stole one of those beers and drank it in the backyard. It was cold and crisp and left my tiny body feeling quite wonderful. I would remember it later.

### ID: p43-3
I was part of the "Just Say No" generation. My youth was filled with memories of DARE (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) classes, Nancy Reagan admonishments against drug use, and commercials with eggs crackling in a frying pan. I had ideas about what my brain would do on drugs.

### ID: p43-4
I was a curious kid with a natural distrust of authority. When I was told not to do something, I tended toward trying it at least once. Just to be sure. My attitude toward drugs was no different.

### ID: p43-5
At twelve, I tried weed. I'd stolen it from a babysitter and smoked it from a pipe made of tin foil. When none of the terrifying things that were promised me in DARE classes developed, I came to the erroneous conclusion that my parents, teachers, and First Lady had all been lying to me about drugs. Within short order, I was smoking pot with other latchkey kids, spending the hours after school and before our parents came home experimenting with our new form of entertainment. It was actually just fun.

### ID: p43-6
At thirteen years old, the fun started to subside. I was arrested at a school dance for possession of marijuana and was suspended for a week. I had always been a good kid and a good student. I'd never been in any serious trouble at school. This was a first for me.

### ID: p43-7
When I returned to school after my suspension, I swiftly realized that people treated me differently. I got attention from kids that normally wouldn't have paid me any mind. Teachers started treating me like an adult. I'd always been smart but too rough around the edges for the nerdy kids, and I'd always been too nerdy for the jockish crowd. Suddenly, I'd found a role that fit me: the smart kid with a wild streak. If the role didn't fit me well at first, I made sure that I fit myself into it.

### ID: p43-8
High school was a bit of a blur. Drug and alcohol use that started out as recreational transformed into daily ritual. Booze and weed eventually included hallucinogens. Cocaine and crank were added to the cocktail. Finally, I found crystal methamphetamine.

### ID: p43-9
I did meth for the first time during my senior year of high school. Something was different about this drug. I felt invincible, I felt like a god. I became a near-daily meth user from the start. Meth became a swift wrecking ball in my life. Within three months of use, I had dropped out of high school and was stealing as a way to support my habit.

### ID: p43-10
When I first started stealing, I tried to have some semblance of ethics about it, ridiculous as that sounds. I didn't steal from individuals. I didn't steal from cars. I didn't steal from homes. But my willingness to cross boundaries with stealing followed a similar progression as my willingness to try increasingly harder drugs, and I eventually found myself stealing whatever I could get my hands on. At eighteen, I was arrested for a string of burglaries and sentenced to more than five years in prison. I paroled at the legal age for drinking.

### ID: p43-11
During my time in county jail, in prison, and on parole, I was introduced to recovery. Twice, I stayed in 30-day residential treatment facilities and was exposed to 12-step programs. I went to meetings and superficially did what was asked of me. Even though it looked like I was in recovery, I wasn't actually doing recovery. My goal was not to stay sober but was, instead, to look good for parents, judges, and parole agents. Though I had decided that I would never use hard drugs like meth again, I had no designs on staying completely sober. I wanted to drink and smoke pot when life circumstances would allow for it.

### ID: p43-12
I started drinking again while I was on parole and, as soon as my state supervision ended, I resumed smoking pot. I used "successfully" like this for a couple of years. I was going to college and doing well. I had a great job. Relationships with family were mostly restored. I had nothing to be concerned about.

### ID: p43-13
Around this time, I took an Eastern Philosophy course in college and was introduced to the teachings of the Buddha. I read about the Four Noble Truths and the three characteristics of existence and felt a great sense of familiarity with them, like they represented a truth that I'd known all along but had somehow forgotten. I just knew the Dharma to be true but, at the same time, I decided that I wasn't suffering enough to worry about it just yet. I would get my chance.

### ID: p43-14
A couple of years after leaving prison, one of my closest childhood friends committed suicide in a very violent manner. It was the closest death had come in my life thus far and it shook me. I felt like the world was crumbling in on me, that I'd been emotionally and spiritually shaken from a foundation. I didn't know how to cope with the way I felt and I didn't have the inner resources to ask for help. I became a daily drinker and relapsed on methamphetamine a few months later.

### ID: p43-15
I started stealing again and my life snowballed in the same way it had seven years earlier. Overwhelmed with sadness, beset with remorse for the harm I was causing yet again, and burdened with shame at the thought of seeking help, I considered suicide but got loaded instead. An imperfect solution, the drugs saved me from myself.

### ID: p43-16
Yet again, I was arrested for a string of burglaries. I found myself facing centuries in prison under California's three strikes law. In the county jail and without the option of getting loaded, my suffering was inescapable. My sadness was inescapable. My remorse was inescapable. My shame, my suicidal ideation, everything, was inescapable. I was forced to look everything square in the face.

### ID: p43-17
There's a reason that the First Noble Truth is about suffering. No transformative path begins without it. Convinced that my life couldn't possibly get any worse than it was at the moment, I decided upon two things. First, I would try my hand at recovery. The worst thing that could happen was nothing. Second, recalling the Buddhism I'd encountered in college three years earlier, I'd give meditation and the Dharma a try.

### ID: p43-18
That was in 2005. There was no mindfulness or Buddhist-based recovery available, so finding recovery and following the Dharma started out as separate paths. On one hand, I started going to 12-step meetings in the county jail, found a sponsor on the streets, and began the process of writing inventories and making amends. On the other hand, I started meditating as best as I knew how. Without a teacher, the internet, or a sangha, I relied solely upon the books that family would generously send me.

### ID: p43-19
I completely misused meditation when I first started practice. Instead of using meditation as a method for meeting reality, I used it as an escape. In this way, meditation served as a substitute for the drugs I no longer had easy access to. I do not judge myself for using my practice this way in the beginning; in so many ways, it was exactly what I needed at the time. I would eventually develop the skills to face my reality more squarely, but it would take time.

### ID: p43-20
After a year and half in the county jail, I accepted a plea bargain of fourteen years in prison. By the time I arrived in Folsom State Prison later that year, I'd been clean from drugs and alcohol for nearly two years, I was prepared to start mentoring other incarcerated men in recovery, and my meditation practice was becoming consistent.

### ID: p43-21
At Folsom, I finally sat in meditation with other people. Two nights per week, I met with Sangha in the fabled Greystone Chapel. Facilitated by volunteers from the outside, these groups were where I really came to understand what mindfulness practice was about. I finally had fellows on the path, and I finally had teachers. Both were absolutely necessary to the flourishing of my meditation and dharma practice.

### ID: p43-22
Every afternoon during count, loud buzzers would sound off in the cell block. So, every afternoon, half an hour before count time, I rolled up a blanket and sat on the floor of my cell. The prison would be my timer. My meditation changed dramatically. No longer was it a method of escape; instead, it became a method of inquiry. In the beginning, it was simple. What was it like to breathe? What was it like to sit on my rolled-up blanket? What was the nature of the sounds in my cell block?

### ID: p43-23
With practice, I started to see that the present moment wasn't as bad as I thought it was. In fact, the present moment, when I wasn't actually thinking about it, was mostly neutral and oftentimes pleasant. This was a bit of a breakthrough for me, because some part of me was convinced that I was supposed to be miserable in prison.

### ID: p43-24
Yes, being in prison was awful. Yes, being away from friends and family was awful. Yes, washing my clothes in the toilet was awful. Yes, yes, yes. But, in time, I came to realize that these things were only awful insofar as I found myself mesmerized by my own narratives about them. My stories about my life were the problem, and I had a lot of them.

### ID: p43-25
Prison, I could not escape. There was no freedom from prison while I was living there. There was, however, freedom from my story about it. I did not have to take prison personally. This insight carried me through the remainder of my prison sentence and into the outside world.

### ID: p43-26
I paroled after seven years of incarceration. There was still no mindfulness or Buddhist-based recovery, so I continued to do in the free world what I had done inside: attend recovery meetings and meditation groups separately. Though I was immensely grateful for the recovery program I had, I nonetheless translated a great deal of the 12-step program into Buddhist terms and practices which better aligned with the way I moved through the world. Finally, after ten years of renunciation from drugs and alcohol, a Buddhist-based path of recovery was developed and I helped to establish it in my local area. This program eventually became the Recovery Dharma of today. I no longer needed to translate my program of recovery.

### ID: p43-27
Since coming home, I have found that six things have been integral to my continued growth in recovery and as a human being. Meditation. Meetings. Study. Service. Friends. Teachers.

### ID: p43-28
I meditate every day and try to participate in a minimum of two silent retreats every year. I regularly attend recovery meetings and other Buddhist meditation groups. I study the teachings of the Buddha in order to develop a deeper understanding of ways to implement them in my life. I take on service positions in my Recovery Dharma groups and share the message of recovery and of the Dharma wherever I can. I maintain friendships with people who nurture and support my own growth. I regularly meet with both a mentor and a Buddhist teacher in order to navigate difficulties in practice and continue to move forward on the path.

### ID: p43-29
My life has been both challenging and beautiful since coming home from prison more than a decade ago.

### ID: p43-30
I have completed state supervision and graduated from university. I have completed a five-year trade apprenticeship and become an elected union official. I have gotten married to a wonderful woman in recovery and become a homeowner. I've traveled to Buddhist pilgrimage sites in India and participated in extended meditation retreats at home and abroad. I have received lay ordination within a Buddhist tradition and started teaching the Dharma to people in California prisons.

### ID: p43-31
I have also navigated complex PTSD and started to unlearn prison survival strategies that were no longer useful to me. I have been present for death when it sweeps through and survived life-altering heart surgery.

### ID: p43-32
Mindfulness, heartfulness, and community are what made and continue to make all of these possible. As one of my teachers has said, Dharma practice has the capacity to transform the very nature of suffering. Awakening might not come in the form of sudden moments of revelation, but instead may entail the gradual digestion of pain and trauma. Over the years, I have progressively come to see the good that has come from past suffering and I try my best to carry that perspective in the present moment, reshaping it with wisdom and love. One line from Recovery Dharma's dedication of merit stands out to me: "As we have learned from practice, great pain does not erase goodness, but in fact informs it." This isn't just a platitude. It's a promise.
## Chapter 44: Berlinda

Content Warning: Childhood sex abuse

### ID: p44-1
My story shows how a person can go from real hardship to a life of balance using community, prayer, the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path. Trauma made me want to numb myself with substances and my practice has allowed me to feel those feelings from the past without reaching out to something to harm myself further.

### ID: p44-2
My childhood was pretty rough. I was raised by a woman who was a sex worker and when I turned eleven years old, she started to traffic me as well. I learned to leave my body and disassociate because that was the only way I could deal with it. I lived that way for a long time. My mother didn't allow us to play with other children of color. We would get beatings for that even though she was dark; a "Morena" herself. Eventually, I was placed in a children's mental institution because I stopped talking. I was there for a couple years before they sent me back to my mother.

### ID: p44-3
When I got home, one of my abusers was visiting my mother so I ran away the first day I came back. As soon as I saw him at the top of the steps, I took off. There was a local delivery boy who I liked and he let me hang out at his apartment while he was working. I told him I didn't want to go back home and about what was going on there. He told me that when he came back from work he would have something for me and that ended up being a bottle. I took that first drink and it felt like, my God, where have you been. Everything disappeared from my mind. I just wanted to have fun. I was giggly for the first time in a very long time.

### ID: p44-4
I had stopped going to school during the third grade. There were no social services at the time; at least for my neighborhood. You didn't see them unless the school complained. I was in and out of juvenile detention and one female lawyer told me I was inappropriately dressed for court and gave me her own stockings to wear for the proceedings. I wanted to stay with her because she was nice to me.

### ID: p44-5
At fifteen, I was emancipated from my mother and began working at a bar. This older lady I met on the bus asked me if I wanted to work. I thought it was going to be cleaning houses or something but when I asked her what she wanted me to do she told me about the bar. The first day I went in for the interview, I had never been inside a bar before and they were putting all these shot glasses in front of me and I asked the lady, Miss. Mary, what the shot glasses were for. She told me eagerly that men were buying me drinks. Since I didn't like the taste of alcohol, she taught me how to make a lemon drop chaser with a slice of lemon covered in sugar. I got hooked on those. I drank for the sensation. I got myself ready for drinks, it was a treat. This was in 1970 at the Golden Slipper on Webster Avenue in the Bronx.

### ID: p44-6
Eventually I found out the go-go dancers at the bar made a lot more money than I did, so I started doing that. I liked it because I didn't actually have to get involved with the men, it was all an illusion. I go-go danced for nine years and made a lot of money. I worked long hours at different places around the city and I drank through all of it. I didn't know that I had crossed that invisible line of addiction. I would isolate and drink, I didn't want to share my drink, I would get territorial with my alcohol. I would keep cups of alcohol around my apartment in different rooms, one in the bathroom next to the toothbrush, one next to the bed which I would reach for as soon as I woke up in the morning.

### ID: p44-7
I gave birth to my daughter when I was almost eighteen. My mother took her because it was either sign her over to my mother or release her to the system. I didn't raise her myself because I couldn't stay with my mother, and I thought that at least I could still see her if she's with family.

### ID: p44-8
I met my husband in the neighborhood. We went to a party together and he came home with me and never left. When I met him he was sniffing heroin and drinking but I made him stop the heroin. He said if I stopped dancing he would marry me the next year. We had a son and, when he was three, my husband wanted us to move to Virginia because his family was down there. We both got jobs, he did maintenance, I cleaned houses. He started getting abusive to the point where I would check into a psych ward for the weekend just to get away from him for a while. I applied for a job at the Department of Corrections (DOC) and he hid the acceptance letter from me under the mattress. He didn't want me making more money because he wouldn't have as much control over me.

### ID: p44-9
In May 1990, I received my first paycheck from the DOC, and I got my own apartment. I put up bunk beds and gave my son the bedroom while I slept out in the living room on a daybed.

### ID: p44-10
During my second or third year at the DOC, I went to a party with fellow officer and they had a lot of coke, so me and another girl went into the kitchen and started cooking it. At the time it was called "freebasing". Before I left the party that night, I was addicted. I ultimately stopped using crack because of my son. I went to my Major and told her I had a problem, and they sent me to rehab.

### ID: p44-11
I was sober for a long time until I met Keena working a temp job at Great Adventure. We figured out a scam where we could pocket ticket money directly, and one day we made $1,500 each. Keena wanted to score drugs with the money, and I told her I would have just a little bit, but we were up all night long. That's when it started up again. We moved up to New Jersey together with my son because he had gotten kicked out of high school in Virginia. He didn't want me to be with Keena, and so he moved out, which hurt me. He felt like I picked her over him, but I felt like my personal relationships were none of his business.

### ID: p44-12
I started having feelings for women when I started dancing but I didn't take it seriously until later. My son knew that I was gay. I had met another woman previously and we were "married"; it's not like it is today, so we had what was called a "holy union". The ceremony took place at a gay church and the pastor asked us what colors we were using in our wedding and we told him purple and silver. He wore purple and silver vestments for our ceremony. She was always good to me. Even after we broke up she helped me raise my son, and they're still in touch to this day. She helped me pay rent and got me a new truck, but all that stopped once Keena came into my life.

### ID: p44-13
Keena and I would argue over who did more of the drugs. I tried to solve our problems by moving, but as soon as we set foot in our new town she was out looking for drugs again. I found a job working for an elderly lady, and she had two large pickle jars full of quarters at her home, and Keena went in there and stole all that lady's money. And of course I got fired. One day when Keena didn't come home, I called Catholic Charities and they put me in a hotel and got me a ticket out of there. Something told me to not look back or say goodbye or nothing. I was so concerned with getting away from her I didn't notice the days and months of sobriety stacking up.

### ID: p44-14
Eventually I came back to New York and started hanging out with the wrong people and picked up crack again; it was something familiar. I lost my apartment and found myself living in an abandoned building with a bunch of other drug users. I moved to a shelter which is where I attended my first 12-step meeting. I went to so many meetings that the facilitator told me I was ready for a meeting outside the shelter. It was on Broadway between 106th and 107th street. That became my home group and the shelter found me an apartment and I moved back to the Bronx. 12-step showed me that I was my own worst enemy and that the only reason I am where I am today is for the grace of God. He was my rehab, for real. He keeps it simple for me.

### ID: p44-15
It still felt like I needed something else; like something was missing. I was surfing the net one day during the height of the 2020 pandemic and I found Recovery Dharma and went to an online meeting. The spirituality of it was very attractive to me. Even though I was new to this type of fellowship, when people spoke I really identified with what they were saying. I asked about a sponsor, or in this case, a mentor, and they hooked me up with another woman who was also living in the Bronx.

### ID: p44-16
I feel safe to tell my whole story in RD because its consideration of people's trauma is part of the practice. I've gone to quite a few different RD meetings and they all have had the same calm energy, I think of it as Buddha energy. There can be tears in meetings and there's no shame. RD is a safe space and I needed that type of energy in my life. 12-steps was the opening, but now there are different and deeper dimensions of recovery, and RD did that for me.

### ID: p44-17
One thing our practice has helped me with is my reactivity. Because of my daily meditation practice and the teachings of the Four Noble Truths and Eightfold Path, I can take a pause before reacting to something that makes me angry. I am still a work in progress, but I know that I'm not in the street anymore and I don't have to protect myself like that. The wise one says to listen and be still. I know I'm getting better because someone said something unwise to me the other day, and I didn't say anything, I just gave them a look over my glasses.

### ID: p44-18
Recovery Dharma has helped me have compassion for myself and others. This has helped me receive love and care from other people, something I haven't been used to. While I don't live the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path perfectly, I strive to. I pray for that. I meditate every morning with a wise friend and lately I've been using healing meditations because I have chronic pain and it's been helpful.

### ID: p44-19
Please don't let me leave you with the impression that this practice is easy because it's not. I used to avoid feeling and now I feel everything. I've learned that when stuff comes up I just let it play out. Sometimes you need to just let the record play. I have a record that was chiseled into my body and there's nothing I can do about that but I try and catch the feelings so I can identify if they're from past or present, if it's guilt or shame. When my past pain haunts me I stop and breath slowly and chant my favorite mantra: Om tare tuttare ture soha.
## Chapter 45: Jean

### ID: p45-1
I started drinking at age eight and within a few years, I was an expert on French wines. My father had died in a plane crash when I was four, I'd recovered from a serious bout of spinal meningitis that same year (leaving me with lifelong learning disabilities), and my mom acquired a female lover when I was six. So, really, why not turn to drinking? My drinking accelerated my senior year in high school, which became one long alcoholic blur. I was accepted to college in October of that year, so not a lot was required of me other than to be upright from time to time. My attraction to other girls was starting to emerge, and I drank in part to fit in, but mostly to numb those feelings.

### ID: p45-2
College took me to the University of Colorado-Boulder in 1969. Please feel free to close your eyes and imagine just how crazy that time was. Pure LSD, incredible leaf, psilocybin, 3.2 beer — we had it all plus a healthy dose of campus revolution. I'd gone from high school in a small town in New Hampshire to an epicenter of the zeitgeist. I was completely unprepared and found an immediate escape in drugs and alcohol. My grades suffered and eventually I dropped out. I did finally own my sexuality and found a short-lived romantic relationship that set the stage for the series of loving, albeit disastrous relationships to come.

### ID: p45-3
At 26, I left behind an epically poor performance as a teacher of kids with developmental disabilities and headed to Arcosanti, a visionary architectural and environmental project emerging in the Arizona desert. Armed with an unemployment paycheck from the state of Illinois and no construction skills whatsoever, I became a dishwasher, rebar manager, electrician, bronze foundry worker, and community networker. In my spare time, I was (of course) a village bartender and drug supplier. At Arcosanti, I found both my purpose and my people. We were a bunch of misfits and idealists, a clown car come to life on a daily basis.

### ID: p45-4
My partner at the time and I left Arcosanti in 1980 with everything we owned in our VW Bug. We landed in Cambridge, Massachusetts and started focusing on work and school. I became a daily blackout drinker, sexually promiscuous and emotionally abusive. I hated myself and I still didn't stop. Finally, the relationship ended and my former partner stopped any form of communication with me for 13 years. I had earned every one of those years.

### ID: p45-5
My last drink was Nyquil on July 4, 1986. Or at least I think it was 1986. It's been a while. But I'm sure it was July 4th, I was lonely, in somebody else's house and looking for some kind of relief from anything at all. I'd been to a few 12-step meetings but thoroughly resisted the idea that I belonged with people who couldn't handle their drinking. That just seemed ridiculous to me, and evidence of a complete failure of will. But I woke up on July 5th and took in the reality that I'd been reduced to someone who drank Nyquil to get high. At that moment, I lost any interest in drinking again and it never came back. I'd lost almost everything: my partner, my home, my self-respect. I literally had no options but to start building a sense of self and doing the work to begin living with integrity, self-respect, and care.

### ID: p45-6
I trundled along with the 12-steps for many years. I did all the stuff — 90 meetings in 90 days, sponsors, social life built around people I'd met in Alcoholics Anonymous, learning to make really bad coffee in church basements, and turning my life over to, well, what? My standing 12-step joke is that I never drank again because I didn't have the energy to get sober again. I tried everything to get my mind around the idea of a higher power, whether that meant the group, the table, or some other random object.

### ID: p45-7
One night, seven years into all of this, I was at a meeting and someone from out of town dropped in. She started talking about the spirit within and the concept of being spirited — honoring and cherishing that quality of spiritedness. I never saw her again, but that night I quit pondering the meaning of higher power and started owning my spiritedness. From that day forward, I became a person in recovery.

### ID: p45-8
It took a few more years to conduct "a searching and fearless moral inventory" because language like that makes me want to hide under the bed, not actually do anything self-reflective. But one afternoon while treading water in a pool in Bethesda, Maryland, I downloaded all my sins to a very nice woman who was serving as my sponsor and she let me know that I'd "got off easy." My track record didn't feel easy to me, but her saying that in such a kind and generous way gave me the emotional space to keep going in recovery.

### ID: p45-9
This same sponsor encouraged me to get inpatient treatment for the history of alcoholism in my family (I'm a third-generation alcoholic). I spent a week at a facility that uses psychodrama and other intense group-oriented therapeutic tools to dig into the mess that was my family and get an understanding of how to end the destructive patterns I had absorbed as a child. I left there feeling free for the first time in my life.

### ID: p45-10
Not surprisingly, it was during this period, at about 12 years sober, that I met the woman, Anna, who I'd go on to marry and live with for 24 years.

### ID: p45-11
Several years into our relationship, Anna and I started looking for meditation teachers. We spent numerous weekends at Breitenbush, our local retreat center in the Oregon Cascades, field-testing various specimens. Some of them were boring, some authentically annoying, and some bordering on creepy. I'd seen Noah Levine's profile in the Breitenbush brochure for several years; he looked a little dangerous but interesting so we signed up for a week with him one summer. Within an hour of listening to him, Anna and I looked at each other and knew we'd found our teacher. Noah's practice community was based in Los Angeles, with Against The Stream serving as his hub organization.

### ID: p45-12
I embraced Dharma with a vengeance. I did retreats, listened to endless podcasts by Theravadan teachers such as John Peacock, Christina Feldman, Gil Fronsdal and others. Noah offered a yearlong book study course co-taught by Mathew Brensilver and so we made the quarterly trek to Los Angeles. I went to Noah's Against The Stream events and loved both the practice and the community. I was initially not excited about Refuge Recovery, the Buddhist-adjacent recovery program Noah developed with community members from Against The Stream, but eventually came around to the idea of a Buddhist-based program that flipped the disease model of alcoholism on its tiny little head. Refuge Recovery annual conferences were a celebration of resilience and hope. The community was thriving and, a couple of years in, I took over from Dave Smith as Executive Director. 12-Step saved my life, Dharma study and practice gave me a life worth living.

### ID: p45-13
I'd heard Noah say that "sooner or later you will lose everything" but I didn't think it would ever apply to Against The Stream. But that's exactly what happened. Things fell apart and some handled it skillfully, and some did not. Along with Amy, Dirk, Dan, Don, Gary, Jessica, Matthew, and Paul (and countless others), we started building Recovery Dharma. We wanted to be intentional in our framework — it had to be peer-led and trauma-informed. It had to have a book that was driven by Dharma. A volunteer from Austin put together a website for us in a week. We were intense and focused and more than a little obsessed. Even though the reality of the need for Recovery Dharma came at much personal loss for some of us, building Recovery Dharma was almost always pure joy and a whole lot of anarchy. I'll never forget the day Paul went live with the Facebook page; he was in Vermont and I was in Oregon and we were texting each other nonstop as the numbers grew. Recovery Dharma was driven by love, not always perfect but always steadfast. I am humbled to witness the growth of our program and all of the people who have put so much faith and care into it. We now have over 10,000 people in our main Facebook group and new folks are stepping in every day to be of service. RD has grown from the same five people doing everything to the point that I don't know half the Board nor most of our Facebook administrators. It's incredibly gratifying to see our program unfold in such an authentic and inspiring way.

### ID: p45-14
At 36 or so years into recovery, I continue to enjoy the benefits of the Three Jewels — Buddha, Dharma and Sangha. Dharma teachings and sangha have enabled me to look at each day as an opportunity to live with intention and compassion. I've experienced the 10,000 joys and the 10,000 sorrows in recovery, and Dharma practice has helped me navigate it all with some measure of self-compassion and equanimity. Impermanence is a part of life and the work I've done has enabled me to navigate it while acknowledging the suffering it can bring. I'm at Arcosanti as I write this, wind bells and birds everywhere. I'm not sure what life is going to bring next but I feel hopeful that Dharma study and practice will give me the "strong back and soft front" taught by Zen Buddhist Roshi Joan Halifax. Recovery is for the fearless amongst us who are equally willing to explore the tenderness and vulnerability of the human experience. Experiencing recovery in community has given me a sense of wholeness and love that I couldn't have found on my own. I am indebted to all who share their practice and gifts in our sangha.
## Chapter 46: Destiny

### ID: p46-1
My brain has blocked out a lot of memories from early childhood. I suppose this repression is some sort of self-defense mechanism. What I do remember is feeling isolated. I never really had much emotional support. For most of my life, my mom has struggled with drug addiction and my dad has been in prison. My mom and I lived with my grandparents in a small town in the middle of nowhere. It was a home riddled with dysfunction and codependency. Because I lacked understanding of the world and coping skills, I thought I was inadequate and incapable of dealing with life. I remember feeling forgotten, overlooked, alone, and scared.

### ID: p46-2
The town we lived in was predominantly Caucasian and partially racist. I am biracial and I struggled to fit in the small country town. I felt like I was too Black for the white kids and too white for the Black kids. I was also very creative, diverse, and a little eccentric. All the other kids in my school had little cliques, but I never felt genuinely included. By 6th grade, I was self-harming to feel "in-control" of my pain. After having an emotional episode in late middle school, I was prescribed Xanax for a short period. For the first time in my life, I felt like I could disconnect from my harsh reality and relax in my own skin. After the doctor cut me off, I continually found other ways to get Xanax.

### ID: p46-3
In high school, I became friends with another attractive outcast who liked to use pills, marijuana, and alcohol just as much as me. She was my partner in crime. For once, I felt seen and understood. I also started getting into toxic relationships as I searched for love, attention, and affection in all the wrong places. Even though I got good grades, I skipped so much school that I had to drop out; I got my GED shortly after. After turning 19, I went to a strip club where I found myself inspired by a dancer and infatuated with the lifestyle. Being an exotic dancer was like being a comedian, therapist, and actress simultaneously. My regulars loved me because I would listen deeply to them.

### ID: p46-4
At the same time, my intentions were insincere. I only listened to them with the condition of being paid for my time. For the most part, the relationships with my customers were artificial and developed through manipulation. But ultimately the person I hurt the most was myself. I was getting deeper and deeper into my drug addiction. I was also addicted to the fast-paced lifestyle and external validation. I was modeling too, and I became attached to the idea I was only worthy if I was desired by others. I was also in a very long and unhealthy relationship with a person who abused me physically and emotionally.

### ID: p46-5
Eventually, I went to jail a couple times for possession. One time was on the 4th of July. I remember watching the fireworks in the county jail through a tiny window behind the bars of my cell. "How ironic," I thought to myself. Later that night, I started going through withdrawals. In the holding cell, another inmate told me that I was an addict and needed to get help. As my mind spun out and my body shut down, it honestly never occurred to me that she might be right. When my abusive relationship ended, I spiraled deeper into addiction. To avoid feeling alone and unwanted, I latched onto a young man I found attractive. We went to a flop house one day looking for drugs. I looked around at the squalor the squatters were living in. How could they live like this? It looked like it had never been cleaned and someone had ripped all the wires out of the walls. However, after my first hit of meth moments later, I moved in with them, and I didn't leave for a while. I was waitressing at the strip club, so I had plenty of money to support my habit. I lost 60 pounds in two months. I also temporarily lost my mind.

### ID: p46-6
At the time I went to my first 12-step meeting, I was back at my grandparents, with no bedroom to call my own, and pregnant. The meetings were the only place that I felt safe. I finally started to gain some understanding about my addiction. I would go to the meetings and just word vomit while sharing around the tables. After relating to other members, I was desperate to turn my life around, so I cast a magic spell for a new beginning. The universe must have had a sense of humor because it promptly burned my grandma's house down. We lost everything.

### ID: p46-7
In some ways though, it was the best thing that could have happened. I relapsed very briefly and went back to meetings where I got a sponsor and started working the steps for my first time. I made a promise to myself. I decided to dedicate my life to healing myself and others. I vowed to be there for my daughter when she was born.

### ID: p46-8
I completed my court ordered probation and monitoring. Then, around eight months into my recovery, after giving birth to my daughter and getting custody of my younger sister, I tried to go to my mom's apartment to take her some groceries. My mom was still using. Her apartment was a mess with squatters coming and going. The scene was permeated with utter despair. Yet, I remember feeling jealous of her — that she could live like this "without a care." I had a brief relapse a couple days later. The vivid image of my mother in those deplorable conditions was a wound that I could not hold space for.

### ID: p46-9
I recommitted to healing. I had finally realized I wanted out of the self-destructive cycle of addiction. I sought help from a therapist. I went back to the 12-step meetings. I reconnected with my sponsor. Additionally, I began meditating and learning to sit with myself.

### ID: p46-10
I used to say my addiction was preying on me, telling my lies. Had I been more aware, I would have been able to identify that scene for what it really was — misery. I would have been able to understand that I was not seeing clearly. Awareness would have allowed me to better understand reality, to reach out to someone for help, and to be there for myself instead of turning on myself and running from the discomfort. Awareness could have saved me from shooting that painful second arrow.

### ID: p46-11
Soon, I would gain new awareness and understanding through the addition of Recovery Dharma to my program. During the COVID-19 pandemic, I started attending RD meetings online. I found this sangha in Birmingham, Alabama that was hosting multiple meetings a week. I quickly became a regular and beloved member of the sangha even though I lived thousands of miles away. I cultivated a network of wise friends who I could check in with and talk to when I felt emotionally distressed.

### ID: p46-12
The RD program made me a more self-compassionate person as well as a more mindful mother and friend. Meditation really changed my life for the better. I find it interesting whenever I see where my mind has gone. Sometimes I laugh at myself. I can focus on the sound of my breath or where I feel the sensation of breath the most. I can label my thoughts as thinking, reminding myself "Oh, this is my critical mind", and letting the thoughts pass naturally like a cloud passing over me through a bright blue sky.

### ID: p46-13
My practice has taught me that — no matter how distressed I become — I can always return to concentrating on my breath. I can take a sacred pause. I can create a safe space for my mind by focusing on my breath. I used to feel mentally agitated and unstable, but now I can soothe my nervous system. I can use wise concentration to choose what to focus on. I do not have to label things "bad" or "good." I do not have to fixate on anything. I can concentrate on my physical sensations and release the stories.

### ID: p46-14
I still honor my truth by gently accepting my feelings and not trying to change them in any way. I also practice not becoming hypnotized by the stories I tell myself. When I experience racing thoughts, I try to remember to pause before acting so I can engage with others more skillfully. I try to engage with myself more skillfully too. I talk to myself kindly, write myself love letters, and listen to affirmations relative to my mood. I try to remember that I am human, and I can accept the ebbs and flows of this experience.

### ID: p46-15
I am intentional with my time now. I wake up early so I can meditate and do my rituals before my daughter wakes up. I love trying new meditations and sampling different spiritual practices. Whenever I do a mindless activity like scrolling on social media, even if for a duration as short as three minutes, I start to feel like a zombie. I can hear my wiser self saying, "Put the phone down." In these instances, I can practice mindfulness by listening to my wiser self and intuition that disconnecting is not serving me.

### ID: p46-16
I still get stressed. I am a single mother and going to school. I have learned to reach out to others when I feel overwhelmed. I consistently confide in my wise friends, my sponsor, and my therapist. I try to get their perspective on a difficult or confusing situation before speaking or acting. Another thing I do is check if I am hungry, angry, lonely, or tired before coming to conclusions. I also use breathwork, ASMR, and binaural beats to calm my nervous system and aid my brain in relaxing. I am a bit of a perfectionist. But, when I find I am being too hard on myself, I remember to breathe and smile at the inner critic when she makes an appearance. The breath creates space in my mind and heart. After calming down, I can ask myself if I am seeing clearly or through filters created in the past (i.e. trauma or learned harmful thinking patterns). I can name the unhelpful additional information as stories and remember that they are contributing to my suffering by adding more confusion.

### ID: p46-17
Today, I feel empowered. I try to be present in every aspect of my life. As a single parent and the legal guardian of my sister, I endeavor to never "check out" and I try to treat my girls with respect and gentleness. I seek out information to understand where they are developmentally so I can have wise understanding of their capacity. I try to remember the basic goodness in people. I recognize that each person is dealing with their own complications, which are causing them to react in habitual ways.

### ID: p46-18
Since I have found Recovery Dharma, I have also been able to help others with their recovery. And I can do this because I now sincerely know that I no longer doubt my own ability to recover. I have become confident that this journey of lifelong growth is the path I was meant to walk. I will continue to dedicate my life to my personal evolution and healing, and I will keep spreading love and light endlessly.

### ID: p46-19
My goal is to leave every moment better than I found it. Anything that passes by me will experience my love.
## Chapter 47: Ned

### ID: p47-1
About seven years ago my administrative assistant told me that I had an urgent call from my significant other. I stopped typing on my computer and grabbed the phone. My partner, Victor, did not wait for me to say hello. "There's someone here at the house from the water company telling me he is turning off our water service!" he shouted into the phone. What? I thought for a minute. I owned the house, lived there with Victor for about thirteen years, was a partner in a prestigious law firm, had all the outward appearances of a successful attorney, and yet my $100 water bill that was 60 days overdue. I had Victor put the guy on the phone and begged him to stop and take a credit card for payment. He said all right. I flipped through my wallet looking for a credit card that still had $100 available and took my best guess. It worked. No water shutoff. Lucky me? Not so much.

### ID: p47-2
How did life get to that chaotic point? Well, I was in a ten-year "relapse" after abstaining from gambling. I had been clean for twelve years at one point, then went back out, and stopped and started in spurts and fits…. until I just gambled until I couldn't gamble anymore. In 12-step recovery I always disliked the term "slip," as I believed the central theme of Gambler's Anonymous — the desire to stop gambling — was the most crucial requirement to progress into recovery. I knew I didn't "slip." Rather, over a period of several years of not working any program, I had lost the desire to abstain. Once that desire was gone, I felt no barriers and reentered the gambling arena with a vengeance.

### ID: p47-3
The compulsion took over my life, as I started to spend more time at local casinos than at my law office. I went before work. I went after work. Initially, I brought a limited amount of cash with me sufficient to "play" for a while and left when it was gone. If I won, I might leave with some winnings, but returned within days to gamble away the winnings and more. Over the period of about five years, I depleted my checking and savings accounts, drew down most of my retirement accounts (for which I still owe taxes on to this day, and worse, had to borrow against my house (which I eventually had to sell to get out of the large mortgage payments), used other people's money (which caused massive shame and self-loathing), and had to borrow from payday lenders against my cars (which were old and needed to be replaced in the first place).

### ID: p47-4
Gamblers learn as I did that it is not just about the lost money. We lose time. We lose focus, perspective, integrity, and drive. Our primary relationships falter. Our family and friends can sense that there is a hidden problem even if they don't become fully aware of the real problem. Our actions poison relationships with family, friends and colleagues. I experienced all these losses. Victor no longer trusted me. I rarely came home until the sun was coming up and he was leaving for his job. I was short-tempered. I was in that mode where one only looks at everything or every person in their life as a means to get something else. For me, that was to get money to gamble and to somehow survive until I could gamble again.

### ID: p47-5
During most of my life, I was active in the LGBTQ and Jewish communities, my legal profession, community service, and in health and education charities. Losing the drive, focus, time, and resources that I used to bring to this work resulted in it all but evaporating from my life. My creative outlets in hobbies such as photography, cooking, writing, and music also dried up. Instead, I spent the majority of my days figuring out the minimum things that I needed to do to just "get by" at work and in life and then spent the rest of the day gambling, figuring out how to get more money to gamble, how to cover the increasing dangers from maxed-out credit cards, NSF checks, and ridiculously high cost payday loans. I had to sell assets or let them go, such as a timeshare which I could no longer pay the yearly maintenance, and some artwork I had managed to collect over the years. I canceled vacations. I canceled home services. Victor picked up the slack around the house but not without just-cause for multiple resentments. In sum, everything I had worked on and for over the years — a stable relationship, a successful workplace, community engagement and a reputation for integrity, were all crumbling under the weight of my insatiable compulsion to gamble.

### ID: p47-6
When I look back at the chaos and suffering during the days in my active addiction, I am most cognizant of my loss of choices. It often felt like my car simply took me to the casino after work. My ability to make wise or safe choices was completely obliterated. The tentacles of my addictive cravings wrapped around every nook and cranny of my brain until I became focused on one thing…gambling, or as its often called, "staying in action."

### ID: p47-7
I somehow had a block against going back to my 12-step program after all those years "in action." I was not wanting to hear judgmental and directive comments, whether well intended or otherwise, from the GA members that I would encounter. Instead I turned to a recommended therapist who specialized in addiction. Among the helpful advice I received from him was that I try a program that he was aware of that was based on Buddhist principles in lieu of the traditional 12-step approach. I followed his advice and never looked back. At Recovery Dharma, I found a non-judgmental space where I could make changes and have a unique and empowered recovery experience.

### ID: p47-8
Through my time in Buddhist recovery programs, and most actively and consistently in Recovery Dharma, I have learned that I DO have choices. I can choose how I act in the face of stress, disappointment, and even happiness. Developing a meditation practice, attending and chairing meetings, writing detailed inquiries, meeting with sangha members outside meetings to share our experiences — have all been key components in finding a better way to live. Learning the difference between feelings and emotions on one hand, and wise action on the other, changed everything for me. It opened me up to change my conduct and choose the compassionate or loving response to tough situations. Along with seeking forgiveness from those I harmed, learning how to act compassionately and practice forgiveness — of myself and others — are key lessons I have gained from working through the path suggested by RD.

### ID: p47-9
It is not magic. It is not instantaneous. It takes work. For an addict, that is very frustrating. We want things right now. I was in active gambling addiction in the last round for about fifteen years, and yet I expected the cleanup would take a year or two. How many journeys work like that? Experiencing the length of time it is taking for me to dig out much of the mess that I created through my own actions is one of the hardest but most important lessons I have learned. Not letting that ongoing experience follow me like a cloud is also part of the learning. Letting go of "what was" and living in "what is" has been key to improving my life. And so if it takes longer than I hoped to get right again, I have also learned to let go of the idea of instantly getting my old life "back."

### ID: p47-10
A compulsive gambler always thinks about "getting it back." The next bet, the next machine, the next deal, the next hand… always beckon with a mysterious allure of an instant fix. That unreal imagery is not for me anymore.

### ID: p47-11
Today I try to live in the present, in the day, in the meeting, in the concert — in the moment. I make sure that I am mindful of what is happening and how I am experiencing it right at that moment. I double check with myself and sift through emotions and feelings to understand how they inform what might be my most constructive or compassionate reaction. I ask myself what is the wisest response in light of these considerations. The issues do not have to be monumental — they can be as everyday as how I consciously respond to a rude sales clerk to the response I provide to an employee that delivers a disappointing performance on an assigned project. Working through situations with the ability to provide a considered response over a knee-jerk reaction provides a much more satisfying and peaceful way to live.

### ID: p47-12
Certain other key concepts from RD enhance the path forward. Service has been key in my recovery, from starting meetings to helping other members with their projects. Sangha has also been important. The connections we make through service and activity within a sangha create a web of protection based on a couple of important attributes that we rarely experience during active addiction: trust and honesty! We learn that we can have relationships based on these qualities outside of the sangha too. Life does get better. Slow progress is always better than a slide backwards because there is no guarantee that we can overcome the next low.

### ID: p47-13
Finally, the RD program and our recoveries rest on our reaching out when we feel vulnerable. It is not easy for an addict, as we spend so much of our active addiction making sure we don't need anyone else and certainly never showing our vulnerability. I have learned that reaching out for help is a crucial part of the transformation from being lost to following the path. It feels risky, but it's proven less risky for me than a spin of a wheel or the turn of a card. The journey on which I find myself today through RD is one of positive transformation. I hope you start or continue your individual journey and follow your own path toward a better life. The RD program is here for you. Reach out.
## Chapter 48: Kara

### ID: p48-1
At about age six, I realized I was different than my family and people around me. I often felt like I was in the wrong family because it appeared from their reactions that no one thought or felt like I did. My experience was that I was either too much or not enough. Due to the discomfort that arose from being me, I found my first solace in imagination and day-dreaming. Escaping my reality to a world I imagined was my first "drug of choice." In that world, I was accepted, included, and belonged.

### ID: p48-2
My heart ached to find others like me. My ears perked when I heard about a far-removed cousin or aunt who was in trouble with drugs. I didn't know much about this, but I was intrigued by the hush of whispering, the "danger" that loomed in bits and pieces of stories I heard. I did not have relationships with these extended family members, but I knew in my heart that somehow, I was like them. The outcasts, the rebels, the creative beings whose emotions and thoughts were so big. I knew that if I could meet them, we would have some unsaid bond. My home was a middle-class Italian-Irish household. My father worked various tech jobs while my mother stayed home to tend to us children. When dad returned home from work, he would have a beer or two. Wine was served at dinner with guests and liquor on special occasions. I detested the smell and had no interest in alcohol or cigarettes, which in the 1980s it seemed everyone smoked and smoked everywhere!

### ID: p48-3
However, at the age of fourteen, the perception of being left out, of not belonging, of criticism for being myself — continued to frustrate me and I often isolated myself further with fantasies in the solace of my room. As a teen, I was confused navigating my social life. Budding friendships blossomed one day, then crashed the next day as I was picked on by my peers. The moodiness and disloyalty amongst peers impacted my feelings of isolation and of feeling different. At home in the solace of my room, I would replay these interactions and rewrite them to be accepted and valued instead of teased or rejected. The ongoing commentary, intrusive thoughts, and self-absorption I felt as I compared myself to my peers was painful.

### ID: p48-4
Then, one ordinary day, I took one of dad's beers and drank it really fast. For the first time, the thoughts stopped. The self-conscious nervousness eased. I continued to drink daily but found that I would black out, so I needed to be careful. I started to hang around with punks, goths, skaters, and metalheads. Like them, I was exploring who I was and what this world was, and experimenting with a plethora of substances. I dropped out of high school. I ran away from home. I was a fixture at the local mall and at nightclubs, which stayed open until 4 a.m. I recall more than one occasion "coming to" with people I had just met, walking in stocking feet in downtown San Jose or in San Francisco as the sun came up.

### ID: p48-5
As for my choice of substances, I didn't ask when you held out your hand with pills, powders, pipes or liquids. I took them all with a smile influenced by Jack Daniels.

### ID: p48-6
At seventeen, I "came to" five months pregnant. I had a few boyfriends within my circle of friends. My self-esteem was nil and the yearning to be accepted led to complicated romances, obscured boundaries, and much heartache. The attachment to being wanted and valued oscillated with thoughts of self-annihilation. But when I found out I was pregnant, I felt I had a reason to live. Flashes of budding flowers, the ocean, trees in the forest, sunbeams; all the beauty in the natural world came to me. I wanted to show my daughter all these things of wonder. Overnight, I stopped using substances for her. At the time, one could not attend school with a child, so I finished high school via independent studies a year later than my friends.

### ID: p48-7
After enrolling in junior college, I was reintroduced to meditation through yoga, a practice I recalled watching as a child on the show "Lilias Yoga and You" on our little black-and-white television. I was intrigued. I was gifted Thich Nhat Hanh's book, The Miracle of Mindfulness and integrated these practices in my daily life. When I was washing dishes, I practiced knowing I was washing dishes. When I was changing the baby's diaper, I practiced knowing I was changing the baby's diaper. Being with my breath during times of stress and times of ease. Being present. I felt as though there was space for everything and there were more instances of ease when "I" was out of the way. The interesting thing is that when I started to read and practice more of the Dharma, it felt like I already knew these practices. It felt like coming home.

### ID: p48-8
I stayed abstinent for a couple years until college. People say you pick up where you left off and that it gets worse. That was my experience. It became much worse. I entered into an abusive relationship, which landed me in the hospital due to physical abuse and neglecting my health. I stayed out of relationships for a bit, then landed in another one that was tumultuous, with more physical and emotional abuse and an abundance of methamphetamine.

### ID: p48-9
All of my "YETs" ("you're eligible too") were happening. All except that I was not incarcerated (my partner was) and I did not die, though I came close numerous times. I was 23 when my boss told me that if I wanted to keep my job, I needed to go to a 12-step meeting. I remember thinking, the audacity of my employer! It was a job at a local art film theater in which all of us worked and used drugs together. In hindsight, this was an intervention. My boss went with me to the meeting, and afterwards we went to the bar and had a beer. Neither of us knew that this was not what one does when trying to get sober from substances. I did not continue attending those meetings. I quit my job and my life spiraled out of control for six months, resulting in an overdose in April 1996. Regret, grief, sorrow, and hopelessness overcame me. I was on the floor when I came to and shortly after, I called my mother. For the first time — or maybe it was the first time that I listened — she told me with tears that she could no longer help me and that I may die from my addiction.

### ID: p48-10
With despair and what felt like having a faint pulse and being near death, I geared up. Literally. It took me eight hours to get ready to go to a noon 12-step meeting, the same one I'd been introduced to by my old boss. Except this time, I announced myself. This time, I listened. This time, I stayed. A couple of weeks in, I started outpatient counseling with an addiction specialist. I worked with him for almost 90 days, then acquired a sponsor, a mentor to work through the 12-steps. I chose this woman because her hair was three different colors, she practiced meditation, and part of her story was hijacking a plane to marry one of the Beatles. I thought, "This woman will not put up with my bullshit and has likely heard it all."

### ID: p48-11
During this time, a few friends and I started a weekly women's recovery group that included Vipassana meditation and mindfulness practices. That group lasted for many years, ebbing and flowing, but the practice was always the same: abstinence, meditation, sharing recovery challenges and strengths, talking about the solution and agreeing to guidelines of wise speech. I didn't know it at the time but it gave me a foundation that was familiar when I later joined Buddhist recovery communities.

### ID: p48-12
I married someone also in recovery and we did service work together, creating a robust and vibrant community. We had a son and bought a house. I continued to hold the women's groups. I've often heard that when we become abstinent and practice mindfulness in as many moments as we can, we will feel better. "Better" does not mean "happy." Better means to feel, with the opportunity to "know" all the sensations of that moment: happy, sad, worried, irritated, loss, joy — all of it!

### ID: p48-13
One lesson for me came in 2008, a difficult year because three people closest to me died, I lost my house, and my daughter went through a traumatic event. One of those who died was my husband, who was killed by someone driving under the influence of alcohol. I found myself parenting on my own again with an eighteen-year-old and a three-year-old. It was overwhelming that one day life is like this and the next, it is like that. And yet this is one of the greatest teachings, anicca, that nothing stays the same and everything changes. All is impermanent. That is not to say I did not grieve or ponder late into the night, questioning who I was. My meditation practice and the support of people in a recovery community who mentored me throughout the first decade of abstinence instilled a confidence or faith in myself. I was in pain, but I did not once think about using a substance to alleviate it. Cravings did not remove me from reality, but helped me to immerse myself in my breath, in the sensations, in the grief in order to understand it. I could only do this because I knew it too would pass because it too was impermanent.

### ID: p48-14
This way of relating to myself allowed me to show up in the world with perseverance, compassion, and courage — utilizing every experience as an opportunity to connect with myself and others and share in the depth of what it means to be human. I was asked to speak at recovery meetings about my experience. I spoke at DUI classes, telling my story to folks stuck in the cycle of alcoholism and driving while intoxicated. I wanted to both educate people about the effects of alcoholism as well as support myself in processing the loss.

### ID: p48-15
When my son was old enough for me to leave him with a sitter, I started attending meditation retreats. This allowed my nervous system to settle, for the internal chatter to settle, and to meet what bubbles up underneath, which is often what I distract myself from feeling. I soon moved closer to the ocean and took refuge in a local Buddhist meditation center, eventually becoming a community Dharma teacher at Insight Santa Cruz.

### ID: p48-16
My focus was on the heart practices (brahmaviharas), the intersection of the Eightfold Path and recovery, and the foundations of mindfulness. In 2013, a friend shared the manuscript of his upcoming book about Buddhist recovery. The components of this program were exactly what I was practicing. It was amazing to create a local, then global, community that integrated meditation and mindfulness practices with abstinence and wise action to be free of entanglements of the mind while building a life within community.

### ID: p48-17
For five years, I was very active in that community. I managed retreats, co-hosted conferences, and engaged in the daily work of fostering a refuge for suffering folks who were clinging to greed, hatred, and delusion in order to eradicate it. Being part of this eclectic sangha was thrilling. Here were the punks, goths, skaters, and metalheads, practicing while listening to great music, the music we grew up on. However, as with all things, there is always the Three Marks of Existence: dukkha (suffering), anicca (impermanence), and anatta (not-self). This Buddhist recovery community was heavily influenced by unhealthy masculinity and inequities among leaders. Great heartache ensued as people were harmed and a sangha was fractured.

### ID: p48-18
In 2019, another Buddhist recovery program and community was created. Recovery Dharma emphasizes trauma-informed approaches and an egalitarian leadership within a diverse community. I moved my effort and energy into this new community as it aligned with the practices of not harming others, taking only what is offered, respecting relationships, being truthful, and practicing abstinence (in short, the Five Precepts) in a way that invited transparency and collaboration among members of the sangha.

### ID: p48-19
It is beautiful that there are many approaches, many paths, all pointing to the same "destination" — to be free from the Three Poisons of greed, hatred, and delusion. To be free of that which entangles the mind and obscures the heart. To be free from suffering and the causes of suffering.

### ID: p48-20
Recovery is a process. It is not an event, but a journey. Along the way we will meet many people. Some will activate unpleasant feelings, but these are our greatest teachers! Some will evoke pleasant feelings where we become attached — these too are our teachers! This ongoing practice teaches us to lean in, be curious, make an effort to understand, and let go.

### ID: p48-21
I am no longer pushing away experiences with myself or others, and I'm not clinging to experiences. I am somewhere in the middle. I'm not attached but aware and engaged. It is a daily, moment-to-moment practice, walking the middle path. It is in this practice that I befriended my own heart and made space for yours. It is in the Dharma that I continue to uncover, discover, and recover my true nature. I will share what was told to me by many others I met along this path: don't take my word for it, see for yourself.

"Sex addict" carries baggage that wasn't all true for me. I didn't even realize, "I'm a sex addict," because my addiction seldom involved having sex. My acting out had more to do with pixels on screens and lusting for the height of self-pleasure. I use the term "lust" because it also includes my zombie mind-state — my insatiable hungry ghost.

My primary addiction is lust. By age five, I was subjected to childhood sexual abuse (CSA). I was told it was a game. At the peak of it, it was the best feeling in the world. Since I enjoyed this game, I never suspected this was trauma or abuse — especially not "compared" to others'. But as Dr. Gabor Maté put it, "Trauma is not what happens to you. It's what happens inside you as a result of what happened to you." Inside, I lived a life of shame and secrecy.

### ID: p49-4
I'm pretty sure my hungry ghost was born the moment I realized I could play this game solo and indulge in self-pleasure anytime. By age six, I was hopelessly addicted. Not to sex, but to the neurochemical hit released by self-pleasure.

### ID: p49-5
My parents would catch me in the act. They were shocked, they would shout, and they would shame me, hoping that it would help me break this habit. They did the best they could with the knowledge they had. But scolding and shaming never helped. It just made it harder to get the help I needed.

### ID: p49-6
What I desperately needed was one safe person. Someone non-judgmental, present, and compassionate. I needed someone to ask me, "What happened?"

### ID: p49-7
Instead, I was saddled with a deep-seated sense of shame as my core identity. Despite how painful my shame was, I could not stop. To protect myself from the pain of shame, I developed a patchwork of unwholesome habits.

### ID: p49-8
To cover up the humiliating behaviors that I felt powerless to change, I learned to lie. It was less painful to tell a lie than to get caught masturbating.

### ID: p49-9
My addiction also compelled me to keep safe by hiding, isolating, and becoming hypervigilant. In fact — I recall the feeling of excitement when adults were going to leave me home alone. I knew that I was soon going to disconnect from the world and act out again. And while acting out, I cultivated lifelong hypervigilance and a fear of environmental disruptions, which paved a road to generalized anxiety disorder.

### ID: p49-10
As a child with an overwhelmed libido, many things that were probably normal to other kids would drive me insane, like seeing people in bathing suits. Walking through the underwear section of a department store. Or seeing models in advertisements. But the worst was just going to school every day. I would always feel attracted to, and in love with, someone in my class — sure it sounds like innocent love in this story, but to live that experience was to be flooded with shameful feelings that I didn't understand.

### ID: p49-11
These were extremely difficult events for me. The feelings were overpowering, agonizing, and confusing. I had no elder nor mentor to guide me through the darkness.

### ID: p49-12
If I pause for a moment and look back at what happened, I see why a child would naturally develop the traits I had. These were survival skills. They served to protect me from immense pain rooted in childhood complex trauma. It's clear to see how these traits predispose anyone to addiction when we list out the traits: dishonesty, secrecy, dissociation, disconnection, isolation, hypervigilance, shame.

### ID: p49-13
In youth, I blamed myself for being unable to control my habits. However, it's clearly unfair to blame the five year old sex addict. So I've always wondered — at what point is it justified to blame the addict for being addicted? Can we blame the ten or fifteen year old for the inability to quit?

### ID: p49-14
It was only in recovery from sex addiction, after completing an inventory, that I recounted and reconciled the wreckage in my rear-view mirror. Doing the inner work of self-inquiry and investigation revealed that lust influenced nearly every decision I made. Here's a tiny fraction of harms that I've tried to restore balance with: I objectified people — I was othering and dehumanizing. When dating, I would use alcohol/drugs/power to coax someone into staying the night. At other times, I would just prefer self-pleasure over actual sex, regardless of how sexually appealing my partner was. In most sexual relations, I found it challenging to reach climax unless I fantasized about porn — even if I hadn't viewed porn for months. When I used porn, I noticed that my tastes progressively became edgier and more shocking in order to achieve arousal.

### ID: p49-15
Just like my drug addiction, I crossed sexual lines I swore I'd never cross. I never thought I would arrange meetups for anonymous sex or compensated companionship. I knew I needed to hit the brakes long ago, but seeking sexual gratification was my life purpose. Without the hungry ghost, could I enjoy life? Who was I before the world got to me?

### ID: p49-16
For about ten years, I drifted in and out of recovery rooms for substance use disorder. Then I turned thirty-nine in the hospital with pancreatitis, from alcohol abuse. Pancreatitis hurts like hell. It felt like I was getting tattooed inside my stomach for ten days straight with zero breaks. But it was less painful than the unassisted withdrawal from a prior fentanyl addiction that ravaged me. I considered pancreatitis a blessing from the universe and a final call to awakening. I said to myself, "This is where it has to stop. When I turn forty, there's no way in samsara that I can still be running on the same toxic rat wheel of addiction."

### ID: p49-17
That year, I began stopping. I slowly let go of who I thought I was. I stopped letting others define happiness and success for me. I stopped blaming others. I stopped denying reality. In the calmness, I could see how my addictive habits were all interconnected: alcohol, drugs, sex, codependency, technology, all of it. Incidentally, it was the same year that Recovery Dharma was established, so I could work on all addictions at the same time by using Buddhist practices to address the root cause of suffering.

### ID: p49-18
For the first time after some ten years of being in recovery, I finally took my recovery program seriously. I asked myself, "How much time was I willing to put into my addictive behaviors? And how much time am I willing to put into my recovery?" An honest, gentle voice from deep within suggested wisely, "Chase your recovery like you chased your addictions."

### ID: p49-19
So when they told me to get into service, I signed up and showed up. When they said to sit daily, I sat daily. When they said to go to meetings as often as possible, it made sense to go to the same number of meetings daily as the number of times I used to act out each day. And when they stressed the importance of sangha and inquiries, I did my best to create real connections within my sanghas and inquiry circles.

### ID: p49-20
Each ingredient of the practice made an important difference. I used to only share when I thought it would get people to approve of me. Then, one day at an in-person meeting, I decided to close my eyes, relax, and just listen. I stopped thinking about what I was going to share. Instead of hearing ways my story was different from the person sharing, I listened for all the ways that we shared common roots. Instead of grasping for external approval, I could finally hear how authenticity and weakness were the truer currency in rooms of recovery.

### ID: p49-21
I made a hard but wise choice, regarding renunciation from love and lust. I decided that, based on my past, I was unsafe to myself if I pursued recovery friendships with those whom I felt attracted to. Some of y'all might be able to handle that, but for this love and lust addict, I might as well be playing Russian roulette with my recovery. It was easier to fully renounce attractive recovery friends for the time, than to eventually have both my recovery and my heart shattered. I learned to love the new life of having true intimacy with friends without attachments of lust. It was a beautiful new road to nurture healthy relationships.

### ID: p49-22
Additionally, since I had experiential success in medication assisted treatment (MAT) for tapering off of opiates and nicotine, I asked health professionals about MAT for calming hypersensitivity to sexual triggers. "If this aphrodisiac exists, then that anti-aphrodisiac exists," I imagined the Buddha fantastically telling Ananda. Eventually, I was recommended herbal supplements. I don't know if they really worked or if it was just the placebo effect, but I didn't care — within a couple months, I had a breakthrough.

### ID: p49-23
I went on a vacation where there was the ocean, beaches, and lots of human beings in bathing suits. Since childhood, this environment was a trigger where I would obsess uncontrollably about the beautiful people passing by. But on that vacation, I was different. People were still beautiful, but I observed myself and became fully present to an unfamiliar "quiet." I could hear myself think! I didn't have to be hyper focused on where each beautiful person was — I found I had a choice over what I concentrated on. I didn't have to obey the hungry ghost. This newfound glimpse of control over my libido astounded me. I had never experienced this level of equanimity and serenity. I was forty years old. That was a very emotional day for me.

### ID: p49-24
Recovery Dharma gave me a way to own my entire story that was drastically different from what I experienced in traditional 12-step spaces. I used to be asked to avoid discussing "unrelated" addictions such as alcohol, drugs, or sex, depending on what kind of meeting I was attending. In RD, I could talk about all the issues of my recovery without being censored. This allowed me to share how critical it is to connect the dots between (1) my process addiction; (2) my substance addiction; and (3) my complex trauma from childhood. In the Dharma, there's no such thing as an "outside issue" to my recovery when all things are interdependent.

### ID: p49-25
Something tells me that Recovery Dharma will withstand the test of time. Not only because it's founded on a healing program that's been helping people for thousands of years, but also because Recovery Dharma is future-proofed: our fellowship doesn't have to spawn a new fellowship for each new process addiction that arises. Among the most powerful aspects of RD is that we are empowered to easily create a new affinity group (special-interest or topic meeting), so we can find others who face, or have overcome, similar struggles. For example, when some of us noticed there wasn't a meeting for people suffering from love and lust, we created a sangha and meetings for it. And you can do the same with your own affinity group. Even though all addictions are welcome at all meetings, I've experienced a deepened connection, wisdom, and healing with others concentrating on the same topic.

### ID: p49-26
I used to make unthinking comments about other process addictions, especially if I didn't relate to the addiction. Eventually, I could see how I was shaming, minimizing, and gossiping about another person's recovery journey. I was unskillfully hindering their healing. I was doing exactly what others had done when shame, stigma, and embarrassment kept me in my spiral of silence for thirty-five years. I've retrained myself to notice before I judge, criticize, or invalidate anyone's struggle. Instead, I reflect on the courage it takes for someone to open up about their inner battlefield. I believe as long as we can honor one another's struggles, this fellowship will thrive.

### ID: p49-27
When I think about the baggage that comes with "sex addict," sometimes my trauma sends me backward and wondering, "Is it really okay to share about sex addiction here in Recovery Dharma?" And then I'm reminded that sex addiction is the very first process addiction that our book specifies — and it's mentioned repeatedly. The authors knew what they were doing. Heck, the Buddha devoted a whole precept to suffering less from our sexual conduct. So if sex addiction is causing you suffering, but you're waiting for permission to share and heal about it, our program and our book have already given us permission.

### ID: p49-28
So, once more with love: it's okay to talk about sex addiction in Recovery Dharma.
## Chapter 50: Randall

### ID: p50-1
I was the "golden child." The one who could seemingly do no wrong. Or at least that was the image that I tried to cultivate. Because when I was less than the best, the consequences at home could be severe. So I stopped asking for help, and I started hiding the parts of me that were deemed weak. I put on a mask of perfection, and the weight of it would almost kill me.

### ID: p50-2
When I was fifteen, I discovered how to use drugs to disconnect from my painful reality. For the next 20 plus years, I would become a mad scientist of sorts seeking to numb my suffering through substances. Feelings were deemed unhelpful and had to go. Productivity was prioritized as I had come to believe that my worth was determined only by how much I could accomplish.

### ID: p50-3
I had to be "golden." So I became an exceptionally high achiever. But I was also just exceptionally high all of the time.

### ID: p50-4
Alcohol was first. It was like a magic elixir that made being around people less scary. Marijuana was next. It could numb the pain of never feeling good enough. Finally, after I became a lawyer, I met my beloved amphetamines. They were the rocket fuel that could propel me to work insane hours, so I could acquire all of the things that would finally make me feel like I was worthy.

### ID: p50-5
The problem was — even after I became the big success that I was groomed to be and procured all of the material things that I had been taught would make me whole — I felt utterly wretched and spiritually empty. I told no one what was going on. I stayed hidden because I thought they would reject me if they knew the "real" me. And, of course, I didn't want them to make me stop.

### ID: p50-6
Instead of looking inward, I blamed all the external things in my life. I tried changing jobs, but I still lacked purpose. And I was still a drug addict. Wherever I went, there I was.

### ID: p50-7
In April 2017, I was coaching my daughter's youth soccer game, and my toes started tingling. "Better not tell anyone," I thought, "they might realize I have a drug problem." But 72 hours later, I had a much bigger problem. The tingling spread to my entire body, and I became paralyzed from head to toe due to a rare auto-immune disease called Guillain-Barre Syndrome.

### ID: p50-8
I was locked in my body and in a state of total isolation for about 40 days. I was on a ventilator and feeding tube and unable to communicate with anyone. I was completely aware of what was happening but cut off from the rest of the world. I started experiencing psychosis, and the traumas of my past and my fears for the future manifested as hallucinations and delusions.

### ID: p50-9
I was also going through withdrawals. I was in the realm of the hungry ghosts. I spent most days sincerely wishing I would die.

### ID: p50-10
Those forty days changed my life. I experienced unimaginable physical, psychological, and emotional pain. It then took several months for me to be able to walk, talk, and take care of myself again. I promised myself that I would make the most of my second chance. And, if my life had been a Hollywood movie, I would have learned my lesson. I would have quit for good.

### ID: p50-11
But that is not the way it works.

### ID: p50-12
Nothing outside of me was going to save me from what was happening internally. Deep within me, there was a demon of sorts, and it manifested as an impulsive and compulsive desire to avoid suffering via self-medicating. I started using again. My wife threatened to leave me and take our three beautiful ginger-haired girls if I did not get help. So, I finally went to treatment.

### ID: p50-13
At the rehab, they would load us on the druggie buggy and haul us off to a 12-step meeting every night. I learned a few helpful things, but the program did not resonate with me. I saw a lot of people who were clean. But, they appeared to still be suffering greatly. I did not want to just stay sober. I wanted to cultivate a life I did not want to escape from. I didn't want to feel powerless. I wanted to be empowered.

### ID: p50-14
One day, my counselor asked me if I wanted to meet with a Buddhist chaplain. "I don't know anything about Buddhism," I thought, "but I'm bored, so why not?" A friendly bald and bearded man appeared at the unit a few hours later. That afternoon, I told him my life story and he introduced me to Buddhism, focusing mostly on the First Noble Truth: "In life, there is suffering." "No shit," I thought to myself as I stared out the fifth floor window of the psych hospital.

### ID: p50-15
The Buddhist "religion" he described did not really seem like a religion at all to me. It seemed more like an ethical framework for living. He told me that there were recovery meetings that used Buddhist-inspired principles and practices. A few nights later, we were allowed to go to one. I walked in the room that night and people were smiling. They seemed to be at ease. The meditation started. I had only meditated once before in my life, and it had not gone well. I was a speed freak after all. But something different happened this time. By the end of the sit, I felt this lightness in my chest. I could not figure out what it was at first, but I just allowed myself to be curious about it until I finally identified it. It was self-compassion. And it felt amazing.

### ID: p50-16
Like I was finally coming home and resting after an arduous journey.

### ID: p50-17
Upon leaving rehab, I immersed myself in the program. Soon, I was one of the regulars. I noticed that the people who served the most seemed to be the most at ease, so I started serving too. When COVID came, I started facilitating multiple meetings a week to stay connected. I began to realize that nothing could help me more than helping other people. So I just kept showing up and serving in positions with more and more responsibility. Eventually, I was elected President of the Board of the global nonprofit and found purpose in protecting and promoting the program. I also kept helping my local sangha grow, and I still go to multiple meetings a week. Because that is where my wise friends are. That is where we heal together.

### ID: p50-18
The reality of my recovery was not a fairy tale where I lived "happily ever after." When my addiction shifted to processes such as bulimia and overexercising, I leaned into my program to establish wise boundaries and stop harming myself. Slowly, I started to make wiser choices and live with more balance. My goal was not to be "golden" or even "happy" anymore. It was just to be present, live with purpose, and suffer less.

### ID: p50-19
Recovery Dharma helped me tap into my Buddha nature. It armed me with an understanding of karma and taught me to plant seeds of self-compassion instead of self-destruction. Through meditation, I increased my ability to sit with emotional distress and cultivate positive mental states. Through inquiry work, I investigated the causes of my suffering and explored solutions.

### ID: p50-20
I used to wake up in despair and need substances to get out of bed and face reality. Now, I wake up early and meditate. I set intentions to follow the precepts and trust the process. I try to practice radical acceptance of myself, others, and reality. When I crave things to be different, I remember the truth of impermanence. When I'm in trouble, I ask for help from my wise friends.

### ID: p50-21
Thanks to Recovery Dharma, I am also a more empathetic partner and gentle father. My family no longer has to be the collateral damage of my implosive cycle. I practice wise speech with my wife and no longer hide my wounded parts. I teach my daughters about meditation and mindfulness, and I can already see how they are coping with stress at school in healthier ways.

### ID: p50-22
I am not "better" though. Just better at being broken. My demons still appear to me on a daily basis. But, when they do, I greet them with a smile and invite them to tea. I sit with them and ask them "what's really going on?" And usually they answer "I don't want to feel this way." So I put my arm around them. And then I have the feelings because - if I don't - they will have me.

### ID: p50-23
I don't have to do anything to "fix" them. I can just let them be. I also recognize that I am going to frequently fail. That's what humans do. So when I fall short, I try to be easy and gentle with myself. Because I am worthy of love and compassion. This is the truth Recovery Dharma has taught me. And the beautiful thing is, you don't even have to believe that it's true. You just have to believe you have the potential to change and heal your life.

### ID: p50-24
And you will.

### ID: p50-25
Above all else, I try to stay present. At meetings, I listen attentively and stay with others through their pain. At home, I read books with my daughters and marinate in the sensation of joy. In these moments of pure presence, I sometimes remind myself that I didn't have to do anything to deserve this. Despite all of the addiction and trauma I have endured, I've been golden all along.

The week I'm writing this, I celebrated seven years of being on this path and Recovery Dharma has been with me for practically the entire time. My sobriety has been built on the wisdom of the Dharma and the empowerment to decide what my recovery should look like.

### ID: p51-2
I was clinging onto about six months of sobriety when I started going to our Buddhist recovery meetings in New York City. At the time, there were only two meetings in the city and one of them happened to be within walking distance of my apartment in Brooklyn. When I came in, I saw a friendly, low-key, queer space and while I was nervous, I also felt safe. The folks I saw there that first evening would eventually invite me to vegan tacos around the corner and one would become my mentor. I wanted to be like these people and spend time with them.

### ID: p51-3
It always felt like I was ancestrally predestined to be an "alcoholic" and to experience the heavy shame that is its close companion. From an early age I was taught about how one becomes an alcoholic and what an alcoholic looks and behaves like. I also learned that it was an identity you didn't share with others, that you had to keep it a secret. My family tradition of silence had been passed down from likely hundreds of years of addiction inspired by the trauma of shame, poverty, and violence.

### ID: p51-4
Active addiction felt like being buried under layers of heavy blankets. I couldn't move, couldn't really breathe, but was also somewhat comfortable laying there, being flattened. It was a way to make myself smaller and quiet my instincts. I think of that Marianne Williamson quote a lot about how we actually fear our brightness and ability more than we fear our darkness and inadequacy.

### ID: p51-5
I don't remember a ton of details from my twelve years of active addiction. I do know that it was fun in the beginning. I worked in media, and drinking was part of the job description. I was good at drinking a lot and it was good for my career. My lifestyle was buying party dresses I couldn't afford, going to boozy events with bold-faced names, staying out until 4 am and sharing hangovers in the office with the coworkers I had partied with. I did a lot of convincing people to drink with me when they didn't really want to and racking up debt trying to keep up with the hungry ghost inside of me. I also put myself in plenty of dangerous situations but like I said, much of it is pretty blurry. I kept going at full speed, abusing my mind and body, knowing that if I slowed down even slightly I may not be able to get going again.

### ID: p51-6
This kind of lifestyle was the one I thought I was supposed to have and what everyone wants to have (besides the debt, danger, and daily hangovers). I was purposefully ignoring and shoving down my need for quiet alone time, reflection, and spirituality. Through therapy and late-in-life diagnoses, I know now that my neurodiverse brain is easily overstimulated by noise, crowds, and visuals and when that happens, I can become nonverbal. I plowed through all of this with the help of alcohol.

### ID: p51-7
Ultimately this all led to my becoming very isolated with terrible depression and anxiety. I couldn't respond to emails or, God forbid, answer phone calls. I could barely finish my sentences when I spoke. I would trail off and go quiet hoping the other person would pick up the end of the thought for me. I didn't have confidence in anything that came out of my head. I would wake up every morning absolutely hating myself, calling myself dumb and ugly and pathetic. I would review, or try to remember, every stupid thing I had said or done the night before and then reel from the shame. That shame took up a leaden residence in my body.

### ID: p51-8
These intense feelings of low self-worth inspired me to seek relationships with the wrong people. I thought I had to drink in order to find connection but drinking only led me to unhealthy connections that ended up lasting years.

### ID: p51-9
Even though I was surrounded by sober people in my family, I found the idea of quitting drinking to be unimaginable. It felt like, if I could do that, I could achieve anything I wanted in life (I still think this is true). Besides the physical and psychological dependence, I'd have to take on the identity of the addict or alcoholic. Someone who had to keep this large shameful part of themselves a secret, who could no longer have fun or be "normal". A life of sobriety was a life sentence and a burden.

### ID: p51-10
I made the first steps to getting sober once the alarm bells from my childhood education about alcoholism got too loud for me to ignore. I was drinking earlier and earlier in the day and my depression and anxiety were becoming unmanageable. My entire life had been taken over by the when, where, how, and what to drink. I was scared that I had to hit my proverbial "rock bottom" before I quit but that turned out not to be true.

### ID: p51-11
There were a number of aspects I knew about traditional recovery that I was wary of. I am used to doing things on my own and taking care of myself, so that's how I was going to do recovery too. No "fellowship" for me! I was lucky enough to find an addiction counselor I connected with right off the bat and she was the one who eventually suggested I check out Buddhist recovery so I could at least have some examples of how sober lives were lived. Or at least the kind of sober life I wanted to live.

### ID: p51-12
When I first started going to meetings, I had never meditated before so I would sit there and kind of peek out and see what people were doing — are they really "meditating"? I didn't get it. Eventually, though, I figured I might as well give it a shot. One of my late-in-life diagnoses was obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and when I started out I thought that if I didn't meditate perfectly it wouldn't count. Luckily, that's not true at all — there's practically no wrong way to meditate. Eventually, meditation started doing its magic on me. I found that if I had a craving I could see it and not get swept up in its pull. The craving would be like a hot air balloon floating all by itself in my head and my natural reaction would be to be curious and kind about it. "Ah, I wonder why that appeared." Through an ongoing meditation practice, I now see other cravings, like for sugar and online shopping, pop up as well. I can investigate why it's coming up: Am I bored? Am I avoiding a difficult emotion?

### ID: p51-13
The concept of "fellowship" or being part of a community of sober people, felt pretty lame to me when I first considered entering recovery. I don't think I'm the only addict that doesn't want to be a burden or rely on or trust other people to be there for me (in fact I know that's not the case because we've dedicated a whole section to it in this book, Isolation and Connection, pg 43). Making these friendships in the beginning had real middle school lunchroom vibes — except in this case everyone invites you to sit with them.

### ID: p51-14
Before the pandemic, our sangha in New York City would get dinner together in Koreatown every Saturday night after our meeting. Over bowls of vegetarian bibimbap we would discuss our sober dating misadventures, ongoing family dramas, and the basics of how to get through life without numbing yourself. Having someone running along-side you can make you want to keep going and forming these friendships has been one of the greatest gifts of my recovery.

### ID: p51-15
This same sangha persuaded me to enter local service leadership positions and because it felt like such a welcoming space with people truly being their different selves, I felt comfortable enough to join with my unsure voice. The more experience I had in service positions, the more confident my voice grew to the extent that I now engage in full-on debates in our RDG board meetings. As the book says, to engage in wise speech is to use our voice, especially if we've felt like "we don't have permission to use our voices or lack the power to speak and be heard" (pg 28).

### ID: p51-16
Sharing my opinions and thoughts out loud can be nerve-wracking and uncomfortable. Many times afterward I would repeatedly go over — and over — the things I said, reviewing them for their articulateness and impact. But I have discovered through this path that the key to freedom is learning to sit through discomfort. And my mindfulness practice helps me do that — identifying where I feel it in my body and letting it be. Granted, it will be a lifelong practice.

### ID: p51-17
My recovery journey, especially the service I have taken part in at my local sangha and the global nonprofit, has done a lot to heal some of that generational trauma I spoke of earlier. I'm healing myself with methods that are the opposite of what has been traditional in my family. I do my best to be kind and compassionate to myself and take time for self-care and healing. And I enjoy sharing my sober identity and speaking about my experience with addiction very openly. The Dharma has taught me that there is no shame in suffering because it is universal. Addiction is simply a symptom of that suffering.

### ID: p51-18
Recovery Dharma's commitment to empowerment has been the foundation of my recovery. To begin to recover, it turned out that I needed to learn to put my needs first, to build confidence in myself and my ability to sit through cravings, anxiety, and other extreme discomfort. I have been able to do all of that, slowly but surely, through this path. RD has taught me I can trust myself and my instincts and that if I listen, I will heal. The voice of the Buddha nature in me is becoming easier to hear. It's soft but sure and it leads me into doing what another fellowship describes as the "next right thing". You have the same voice inside of you too.

I bought a pack of cigarettes as soon as I could after I quit drinking. I told myself I deserved something if I wasn't going to have my nightly bottles of white wine and glasses of Jameson, and everybody knows that folks in recovery are some of the heaviest smokers out there. So I started with Camel regulars, and ended up with American Spirit unfiltered. I went from cups of coffee to extra-large buckets of Dunkin' Donuts caramel-swirl-extra-cream-extra-sugar, and from an online flirtation into an affair that almost brought my marriage to an end. I just always kept reaching for something else.

### ID: p52-2
I like to say I was lucky because I started out with a lot of friends who were already in recovery. Noah Levine's book Dharma Punx welcomed a lot of misfits like me to Buddhism: a way of approaching this ancient path that didn't seem as bougie and hippie-dippy as I thought so much of American Buddhism was. A bunch of folks from the old Boston hardcore scene — sober and otherwise — started up a Dharma Punx meeting in a recovery center right on Paul Revere's route in Arlington, and I decided I may as well check that out. What I found was not just meditation, but community: people honestly sharing with the confidentiality and safety that, as I'd learn, is the heart and soul of so many recovery groups. That safe space became a Refuge that a lot of us had nowhere else in our lives. We built friendships in that room. I met my future wife in that room. And when I finally made a decision to quit, I had people I could call from that room.

### ID: p52-3
Okay, I was lucky. But maybe, just maybe, there was also some part of me that knew deep down that there was something I needed to hear in those meetings.

Fast-forward a few years. In 2013, bombs went off at the finish line of the Boston Marathon, killing three people and wounding hundreds. As the cops frantically chased the bombers through the cities of Boston, Cambridge, Watertown and Somerville, folks were locked down and told to shelter in place. But in Somerville, where I was living, liquor stores were still open. (because this is Mass we're talking about here). I spent that week day-drinking, with my wife out of town and unable to come home. That was the beginning of the end for me; I probably didn't have another sober day in the next six months. The blackouts got longer. I started hiding nips of liquor everywhere. I listened to my sober friends at Dharma Punx share about their drinking and using, and I began to see myself in those stories. To be honest, I think I quit partly because I wanted to be like my tough and courageous friends…even though my life, as they say, had become unmanageable, I didn't really feel like it. Yet.

### ID: p52-5
I started going to 12-step meetings, which are everywhere in hard-drinking Boston. I'd picked up a lot of horror stories from my Punx friends, though, about the narrow-mindedness and religiosity in the rooms, and so I was looking for something to be wrong even if it wasn't. Buddhist recovery wasn't really a 'thing' yet: Noah and his crew were still working on what would become Refuge Recovery, and books like Vimalasara's Eight Step Recovery and Kevin Griffin's One Breath at a Time were out there but local meetings hadn't been organized. So 12-step was, pretty much, the only game in town. There were a couple meetings I went to for a while, but I didn't do anything else. I didn't work a program, didn't get a sponsor. I was skeptical — like a lot of people, for good reason — of sponsorship and the Steps, but I just used that critique as a reason to "white-knuckle" my sobriety.

### ID: p52-6
The phenomenon of cross-addiction — of replacing one addiction with another — wasn't talked about much in the rooms of 12-step… or I sure as hell didn't hear it if it was. What I heard was "just don't drink," and I didn't. But I was up to a pack a day, I gained fifty pounds off of Dunks and salted caramel ice cream, and I was flirting compulsively online and in the real world. We'd moved to Vermont the year after I quit, and I found small-town meetings even more grumpy and Jesus-y than my old Cambridge home group. I was in free-fall. I started to think that it wouldn't be a big deal to just taste some of those famous Vermont microbrews and small-batch liquors. And my flirtations became long, graphic, intense conversations that took up hours of my days.

### ID: p52-7
You can probably see where this is going. Eventually, my wife found out.

### ID: p52-8
I got a sponsor and dragged myself back to 12-step, and it helped. It did. I worked the Steps, and I got a shrink and a prescription for Prozac because I felt like home-cooked crap 24 hours a day. My Fourth Step was a long, detailed narrative of all the people I'd screwed over with my drinking, using, and womanizing, and what a waste of skin I'd been for as long as I could remember. My wife hadn't left — yet — but it was still a day-to-day thing. I switched from cigarettes to caramel-flavored nicotine vape, but I was constantly restless, unsettled, and filled with self-rage. And then, I got lucky. Again.

### ID: p52-9
One day, I was meditating on my back porch using the Insight Timer app and I got a friend request. My new friend gave me some suggestions for guided meditations and told me about a Refuge Recovery meeting they were starting up in our little town. So, almost on a whim, I showed up. I read the book and came back most every week, and that's when things started to shift. I finally had a group of people I could be real with, like the Punx back in Boston. And I started to see how Buddhism and recovery fit together.

### ID: p52-10
But this path brought me face to face, again and again, with what in the Recovery Dharma book we call the "heart practices:" appreciative joy, compassion, lovingkindness, and equanimity. Getting into my heart — getting comfortable with my heart — has been the absolute key to my recovery and, especially at the start, was one of the hardest things I've ever tried to do. I can't even remember how many times I completely shut down right at the start of mettā (lovingkindness) meditation. Why? Because usually the way it begins is that you're supposed to send mettā to yourself. And I would just nope right the hell out of that. To the cynic in me, it just seemed like hippie-dippy nonsense. Deeper down, though? I just could not connect to the feeling of wanting myself to be well. I had this unconscious message in me that I had to be tough on myself if I was going to get anywhere in my recovery. What I didn't realize yet is that it was just the opposite: staying hard and closed was keeping me stuck.

### ID: p52-11
An opening came when a wise friend shared a recorded meditation — I think maybe it was led by Tara Brach, but I'm not sure — that started by sending mettā to a loved one rather than yourself. I didn't have a hard time with that, so I was able to stay with it. The focus of the meditation then moved on to a neutral person, to a difficult person, and to the whole world, and only then asked me to send mettā to myself. This was the break that I needed: the realization that if I could send well-wishes to the worst people in the world — dictators, murderers, people who spoil the ends of movies — I could also send them to me.

### ID: p52-12
This let me make some space in my mind and heart so I could stay present rather than shutting down into judgment, self-hatred, and fear. I stopped needing to numb that suffering with something, anything: nicotine, sugar, social media, whatever. I started to be able to look honestly at my past without getting stuck in a story about what a piece of shit I was, and began to recover.

### ID: p52-13
It made a huge difference to me that in Buddhist recovery we don't talk about it like recovery from illness. Instead, I saw myself as 'recovering' a lost part of myself, what the book refers to as "the part of us that's not traumatized, that's not addicted, that's not ruled by fear or shame" the part, it says, "where wisdom comes from" (pg 2). I became kinder, more patient, and a better wise friend to others because I had started to care about the suffering I'd been causing myself for so long. And instead of giving myself a hard time for giving myself a hard time, I could soften into it. I could see how my suffering was like the suffering of others. And I could finally, authentically, let my heart open.

### ID: p52-14
And again, I do feel like I've been lucky. I'll never deny that. At the same time, I have gratitude for the part of me "where wisdom comes from:" the part that was looking for healing before I even knew that's what I needed. I've come to trust that part of me, and I've been fortunate to be in community with other people who have recovered what the book calls "the pure, radiant, courageous heart where we find our potential for awakening." We've grown together as wise friends and supported each other through hard times and good. I was able to be present enough to heal my marriage through years of patient work with a kick-ass counselor. We even decided to start a family: something I never thought I would be grown-up enough or emotionally stable enough to do. I went back to school, earned a master's degree, and started to teach writing at a local community college. And I've been able to be of service to other people in recovery: facilitating my home group, acting as a mentor, and bringing a Recovery Dharma meeting into an inpatient detox facility.

### ID: p52-15
So whenever anybody asks about it, I try to encourage them to lean in to that hippie-dippy nonsense. It might be easy, or it might be as hard as it's been for me.

### ID: p52-16
But I always say, and I always will, that it is absolutely, without a doubt, 100% worth it.
## Chapter 53: Eunsung

Content Warning: Suicide

### ID: p53-1
I was born in South Korea and grew up in a rural area near the demilitarized zone. Overall, I had a happy childhood, but I also had to endure several episodes of violence and trauma. It is only through the healing of recovery and living a spiritual life that I can look back with joy and have compassion for my family and the generations of people who had to experience the suffering of living in that impoverished and war-torn area.

### ID: p53-2
When I was in the third grade, my family immigrated to the mountains of Appalachia in North Carolina. I already felt different before coming to the United States, but when I arrived I really felt out of place. I experienced what it was like to be othered. Due to the racism prevalent in the area, I felt isolated and unsafe at school and around town.

### ID: p53-3
When I got drunk and high for the first time, none of the heaviness of what I was experiencing mattered anymore. The name-calling and stares from other kids faded away. I felt like I could breathe deeply for the first time. I was painfully shy, and alcohol and drugs gave me the power to connect with others. I never thought substances would take me to a dark place. The tragedy of addiction was that what I thought was a solution to my suffering would eventually create more suffering for myself and my loved ones.

### ID: p53-4
I first found meditation when I was in college and read a neat little book on Taoist Alchemy. I meditated for the first time visualizing a golden egg melting down my body. I still drank and got high, even while meditating. I can see now that I was using meditation as another escape. I wasn't at peace with my present reality. I always ran.

### ID: p53-5
The next few years were a blur. After I graduated college, I worked as a wilderness camp counselor. One day, I had an alcohol-induced "epiphany." I thought, if this is all there is to life, then screw it, I am going to kill myself. But I also thought that I would like to see New Mexico before I died. Instead of driving back to work, I started driving west to Mt. Taylor in New Mexico. I walked out into the woods thinking I would have some grand spiritual experience. I didn't find enlightenment, but I did decide to not give up on life that day.

### ID: p53-6
I didn't get into recovery then. It would take multiple suicide attempts, lots of punk shows, and more aimless wandering before I found my way to healing. I still meditated periodically and I found some peace in Buddhist communities. But I am not sure if my sitting against a wall doing zazen eventually led me to where I am now. I was lost, and it felt like I was always aimlessly pursuing a new relationship or going to a new place to quiet the discomfort I felt on the inside. I lost relationships and career opportunities due to drugs and alcohol. It was a bit of a blur, but during this period I made multiple attempts at taking my life and none of them were successful. I felt so empty. I was lost in dukkha.

### ID: p53-7
I was living with my father and helping out at his church. I thought maybe I could bring anarchist philosophy into Christianity and wake up the boys I taught in bible study. So I went to a prestigious grad school in North Carolina and tried to appear spiritual. I also got involved with the Buddhist community at the school, and I led the morning sits on a regular basis. I was studying theology, interning at churches, leading youth groups, preaching, and leading prayer groups. I felt fake as I lived a double life. I was studying how to be a spiritual leader to others while I was hung over and miserable in my own life. I was not able to practice what I preached. I thought that if people could see how I really felt on the inside and the life I led, they would all reject me. At this time, my physical health started to deteriorate quickly as well.

### ID: p53-8
I left graduate school with a degree and lived and worked at an interfaith community in Washington, D.C. where people with and without intellectual disabilities shared life together. I once again lived a double life. I spent days being with people in a community that taught me to embrace my vulnerability, but at night I would numb my feelings by drinking. In the beginning, I would go out to bars in my neighborhood with friends, but toward the end I preferred drinking alone in my basement. Once again, my addiction led me to self-harm and suicidal thoughts.

### ID: p53-9
It was at that dark moment that I finally admitted to someone that I might have a problem. I finally got into recovery in October 2011. It hasn't been a perfect journey, but I am grateful for each moment and each day. I got clean initially through 12-step programs, but meditation was vital to my recovery. I had to relearn to meditate when I got clean. Sometimes, staring at a lit candle to start my day was the only peace I had from the chaos of my thoughts.

### ID: p53-10
I moved to Virginia in 2014. At the time, I was married and expecting the birth of a daughter. I got connected to the recovery community in a new place and kept meditating and walking the path as best I could. I would sometimes meditate with my daughter sleeping on my chest, feeling her breath against mine. It truly is an amazing gift to be a parent in recovery.

### ID: p53-11
I like to tell people that I found my way to Buddhist recovery by accident. I asked a friend from a 12-step group to start an 11th-step meeting with me, and they declined but instead asked me if I wanted to start a Refuge Recovery meeting. I had never heard of a recovery program that utilized Buddhist principles. In June 2014, we held our first meeting. Ever since then, my sangha has been vital to my recovery. Especially when I went through a divorce, the meetings became a safe place for me to just sit in silence and fall apart.

### ID: p53-12
In 2019, I went to the Refuge Recovery annual conference in Chicago, and it felt like all hell had broken loose. I was in shock going to my first Buddhist recovery conference and walking into division. It turned out that was the pivotal moment Recovery Dharma was born. I remember reading a draft of the Recovery Dharma book on the L train on my way to the airport to head back home. It felt like my heart was connecting with each word. I could feel not just one individual voice speaking to me, but a group of people sharing their experience and practice. A few people from my local sangha attended the conference in Chicago with me, and we brought back our experience and shared why it was so vital that our sangha transition to Recovery Dharma. Shortly after that, all of the meetings in our area voted to switch from Refuge to RD.

### ID: p53-13
I thought all the turmoil and chaos would be over, but little did I know another storm was coming. My local sangha was based in a city full of Confederate monuments, and it would be the epicenter of protests in the aftermath of George Floyd's murder — in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic. The monuments fell, and I had my practice to guide me so I could skillfully listen to my conscience without causing more suffering to myself and others. Some of my sangha's members died from overdose or addiction-related health reasons. It was a strange time, and I am still processing all the grief and loss. I decided to start another Recovery Dharma group online, and I facilitated and participated in inquiry circles. I tried to help others and live by the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path.

### ID: p53-14
My life today is one of increased connection and hope. As a hospice chaplain and grief counselor, I use my practice to be present and help others pass through times of transition and loss. I try to touch my own pain and the suffering of others with compassion. I try to see the beauty all around me in the small moments. Whether I am surfing a wave, going for a walk with my daughter, or even just sitting in traffic I try to stay present. I focus on my breath and recognize that I can mindfully breathe through any change and I can help others to do the same.

### ID: p53-15
In these ways, I continue to help myself and others through my practice. I practice when life gets hard, and I also practice when life gets good. Buddhism and RD have given me a strong foundation, so I am empowered to transform my own life in a skillful way. I have taken on a lot of responsibility in the RD community, and lately my work has been preparing others to be peer leaders and doing so with compassion. I have found new meaning and purpose in Buddhist recovery and a path that helps me be present to life.

### ID: p53-16
I hope my story guides someone who is lost and searching for the three jewels: Buddha, Dharma and Sangha. And remember — you do not have to walk this path alone.

### ID: p53-17
May you be happy. May you be at ease. May you be free from suffering.
## Chapter 40: Amy
### ID: p40-1
Like so many of us, I grew up never being taught what to do with my feelings, raised by parents who were never taught what to do with theirs. And like so many of us, trauma scarred my young life. I experienced those traumas alone, with no tools except the ability to compartmentalize my feelings and fragment myself. It is no surprise that when I discovered drugs and alcohol at the age of thirteen, it felt like an epiphany. Here was the perfect way to run from myself, to numb my pain, to create what felt like a safe little world all my own where no one could touch me. And even when they did touch me, I couldn’t feel it.

### ID: p40-4
Right from the start, I loved using alone. That was my preferred
way of getting high, although of course I also did it socially. I would also
get high secretly and not tell anyone, sitting there surrounded by people,
feeling like a ghost. But what I loved most was sitting in my room by
myself, convincing myself that this place I created inside my head was the
real world, and the one outside, the one full of people and pain, was just
an illusion.
### ID: p40-3
The first time I went to rehab, I was sixteen, driven by a depression that no amount of drugs seemed to improve. I wanted it to work,
and I approached sobriety like the straight-A student I was. But after a
year and a half, I was lonelier than ever, and I convinced myself that I
could drink and use like a normal person. Not even two years later, I
dropped out of my dream college, addicted to cocaine, suffering severe
mental health issues, and wanting to die.
### ID: p40-4
By the time I finally got sober at age twenty-eight. I had spent
years eking out alife despite myself. I hit a few bottoms on my way there,
but somehow I ended up with a promising career, a nice partner, and a
house. As always, I lived a double life, my troubled inner world hidden
by my armor of privilege and accomplishment. But I was so tired. I had
tried in vain for years to control my drinking and drug use, doing all the
things we do to lie to ourselves. I managed to quit drugs, but I would
always drink again, not knowing what else to do with the feelings that
would inevitably come up, the discomfort I had no idea how to sit with.
### ID: p40-5
I went to rehab again and threw myself into AA. I was lucky to
have gotten sober in the Bay Area, where the 12-step community was
diverse and progressive, where it was possible to find a cozy niche of
women’s and queer meetings that felt like home, where they didn’t say the
Lord’s prayer, and where their approach to the program and the Big Book 
was more trauma-informed and less dogmatic than many other places
### ID: p40-6
For the first time in my life, I felt like I found my people, and I
began finding myself. I learned how to be close to people. I learned how
to take responsibility for my actions, and I learned that my actions affec -
ed other people. Somehow, that had never occurred to me. I had been
so consumed by my own pain for so much of my life, in some way I had
started to believe I was the only one who felt anything.
### ID: p40-7
I had a good early recovery in 12-steps, and I am grateful. In my
first few years, I also started exploring Buddhism, going to a day-long
retreat and a few meditation groups here and there, reading everything I
could find about a Buddhist approach to the 12-steps. I thought I, and
my program, were invincible. At five years sober and a mother to an
almost one-year old, my partner and I decided we were done with city
living and moved across the country to the mountains of North Carolina.
I had always been good at moving, running from problem to problem
and starting over somewhere else. But this time, I wasn’t running from
something — or so I thought. My life in the Bay Area had been wonderful, but I was ready to start the next chapter of my life.
### ID: p40-8
Something was missing, and I thought I would find it in this
unfamiliar place surrounded by strangers.
But it didn’t go quite as planned. I had expected to just fall into
12-steps here and find a new friend group like I did back in California.
But the meetings were weird, full of a southern Christian God and what
seemed like questionable recovery. Theold-timers sounded like cult leaders. The repetition of readings and sayings and slogans began to wear
thin. With the stress of a young child and a huge life transition, and without the community we had back in the Bay, the cracks in my marriage also started to show. I was lonely in North Carolina, and the foundation of both my recovery and my personal life was starting to feel shaky

Then I found a flier on a coffee shop bulletin board for a Buddhist recovery group, and I decided to give it a try. Themeeting was just a handful of quirky-looking people sitting on cushions in a circle on the floor, talking about their lives in what felt like a refreshingly intimate and authentic way. I immediately felt like this was the room I wanted to be in.
### ID: p40-11
Over the next several months, I found a home in this new community. I began to see my personal growth with a Buddhist lens, addiction as something much deeper than a dependency on chemicals or even
a disease. Yearning was the human condition, and we addicts, through
whatever concoction of trauma and adverse childhood experiences and 
hereditary influences, came to feel these yearnings more intensely, often
for things beyond substances. Buddhism deepened my recovery in ways
I never imagined possible in 12-steps, inviting me to not only look outward at systems created by others, but ultimately look inward and trust my own wisdom.

### ID: p40-12
That is not to say I think I know all the answers. I certainly knew
very little about how to live an honest and healthy life when I got sober,
and I needed to look outward for wisdom, to trusted groups and people
who I knew had something valuable to teach me. I believe being humble
is essential to wisdom. But as my recovery deepens, so does my trust of
my ability to make healthy choices — and to also know when I need help
figuring out what those healthy choices are.
### ID: p40-13
It is easy for me to focus solely on the inward-looking aspects of
Buddhism and convince myself sometimes that this is a solitary path. But
there is a reason sangha is one of the three jewels at the core of this path,
and I know I cannot do this alone.
### ID: p40-14
It is easy for me to make Buddhism complicated, to over-intellectualize, but I also know that I feel most grounded when I focus on
just being with experience rather than judging or analyzing it. When in
doubt, I remind myself of the core teaching: do no harm. I remind myself
that includes not doing harm to myself.
### ID: p40-15
Buddhist recovery has taught me the importance of being kind
and gentle to myself. It has taught me to look at my intentions and motivations for doing things. It has helped me understand that I can find
peace regardless of what is happening outside of myself, and that I do not
need external validation to feel that I am enough. And I am finding that
the more I feel that I am enough, the less I crave other things to fill me up.
### ID: p40-16
When we started Recovery Dharma, one of our core intentions
was to emphasize that this is a program of empowerment, not powerlessness. Acceptance of what is is part of equanimity and integral to our liberation, but that is not the same as powerlessness. As a writer, I know that
words matter. As a survivor of trauma among so many other survivors of
trauma, I know that powerlessness is not what I want my recovery to be
based on. Instead, I see my recovery as a path towards wholeness and
embodied, empowered choices.
### ID: p40-17
I may not always have power over what happens in the world,
what happens to me, or even my own feelings, but I have power in how I
choose to respond. Sometimes that power is limited by old patterns and
trauma response, but it is still there. My Buddha nature, my liberation,
is always inside me, always accessible. I have the power to be kind and
gentle to myself and others. I have the power to set boundaries, and also
to forgive. I have the power to look at my various human yearnings and
discern what is motivated by craving versus what is motivated by curiosity, connection, and joy. I have the power to be present and breathe
through whatever life brings me, and to be grateful for all of it.

## Chapter 41: Chance

### ID: p41-1
Dharma, sobriety, and my identity are delightfully blended. The pivotal push to getting sober was a feeling of disconnection from my chosen family, and from myself. An occasionally deep, often mild, haunting sensation of hindered intimacy. I wanted to show up and be truly me, meeting truly them, but there was always this cloudy curtain between us.

### ID: p41-2
When I was eleven, I started with alcohol, and my mom was one of those "as long as it's at home, substance use is okay" kind of parents. I was eleven and a lot of my friends were sixteen, so you know we were drinking and driving, and then soon added pot, and acid, and mushrooms. I grew up in rural Ohio, and nature was a big part of my experience as a teen. We talked like we thought the substances brought us closer to nature and its beauty and mystery, but probably we would have gotten closer to the elements had we been sober and actually present. Either way, I was able to escape home and two parents who didn't talk, slept in separate beds, and yet supposedly were staying together for me, by zipping off and flying high with my crew. I also did a lot of drugs with my mom. She introduced me to cocaine, meth, and crack. Our shared dependence was a distorted parent-child closeness. She was, and still is, hurt and lonely.

### ID: p41-3
I excelled in my tiny Catholic high school. I was a perfectionist, took all the advanced classes, skipped a grade in French, wrote for the newspaper, pushed vegetarianism. I eventually graduated as the valedictorian. I'd jam all my homework during lunch time so that I'd be free to check out as fully as possible from after school until bedtime with drugs. And that was the cycle, day after day.

### ID: p41-4
My queerness emerged early on. In 6th grade, I famously declared, "When I grow up, I'm going to be bisexual." Which to this day, I'm fully embodying. However, in small town, sex-negative USA, this was easier said than done. When I became (at that time) a girl kissing girls, the hang ups and harassing phone calls to our house line started happening. I never denied my desires or who I am, and I paid for it, but I never considered another way to be. I had a high school girlfriend when I was in 8th grade, and we partied and learned bodies.

### ID: p41-5
College and grad school were more of the same. Me working so hard and then rewarding myself at the end of the day and fuzzing out. More and more special people came into my life, through queer, activist, and academic communities. I love relationship building, exploring, navigating, co-finding channels for growth and creativity. Yet I felt the channels were blocked, and separation was apparent.

### ID: p41-6
In Fall 2012, I decided my drinking was out of control. I had never really liked alcohol. Both of my parents were alcoholics and addicts, and I just couldn't be like them. So I cut out the alcohol, because I thought that was the problem. Things definitely felt less chaotic, and my body felt better. But the drugs continued - so much marijuana daily, plus MDMA and psychedelics often. The disconnection with my romantic partners was palpable, so I enacted a "sober sex only" policy for myself and my dates. I learned quite a bit about queerness, presence, and substances then. Many people couldn't easily set aside drinks and/or drugs in preparation for sex. These early negotiations around substances and physicality were significant. They were empowering, and I was able to practice directness and consent.

### ID: p41-7
Yet stopping at sober sex wasn't enough. After six months of the policy, the same six months on gender-affirmin hormone therapy, I went on a trip to Las Vegas with a sex worker collective I was part of, and — while I didn't know that it would be the last time — I took my last dose of drugs in the desert. The next day was my dad's birthday, not an uncomplicated date, and that became my sobriety anniversary.

### ID: p41-8
I stopped because I had had enough. On that desert walk in my altered state, alone but with others, I just thought about how I could get to so many of these same places with my meditation practice and so much less clinging and opacity. I was in the middle of a 90 and 90 meditation challenge I was doing with a dharma buddy, where we would meditate 90 minutes a day for 90 days. I was committed, and I was ready for change.

### ID: p41-9
Upon abstaining, I had a built-in network of sober friends from my meditation community, which held a lot of sober punks. At the same time, it felt like a magnificent shift and very organic. It was simple, but not easy. I lost friends. I broke up with most of my romantic relationships. A lot of people asking "WHY???" "You don't have a problem?" "You never seemed like things got out of control," etc., etc. This still happens, and I'm celebrating my ten-year soberversary.

### ID: p41-10
Getting sober required a lot of release. Staying sober requires doing all the ancillary work, in addition to being active in a recovery community. Dharma, sangha, honesty, connection, communication, compassion, rupture, repair… This one-line string of words and principles encapsulates an ever-challenging life practice of being a better person and causing less harm and bringing more joy into the world. I'm extremely grateful to be embedded in a community that can reflect back these values while we all stumble trustfully together.

I am one of the stewards of our first NYC-area queer Recovery Dharma meeting, and it's truly magic. Queer and trans people healing together on this path, we especially need each other and this space where we can process shared experience and difficulties Service has always been a large part of my recovery. Whether I was an Intersangha Rep, or Events Chair organizing daylong retreats and my favorite — the New Year's Eve gathering, meeting chair, mentor/wise friend, meeting location finder and conduit…showing up, opening up, being an anchor, feeling anchored by others, and holding space is central to nourishing the group's collective health and continuation.

I like this saying that I've heard from a few Dharma teachers, "Don't waste your suffering " For me, this points to the power of transformation in the Eightfold Path. It's especially supportive because it's not a consecutive sequence. To me, the Dharma is kaleidoscopic. Each little bit of the path catches and mirrors back countless other pieces of the path.

I've spent a lot of time tuning into ethics (known as sīla in Pāli), the three stages along the Eightfold Path — right speech, right action, and right livelihood. Growing up, I received messages that it was okay to screw other people over to get ahead. This ethos ran deep, and I've had to, and continue to do a lot of undoing and behavioral remodeling work. I don't waste the suffering that can be transmuted when I am tempted to or act in an unskillful way and catch myself. I check how my body and heart feel, note it, and investigate those qualities. I also try not to beat myself up and instead practice self-compassion. And when I choose a skillful action, I feel into the gratitude and joy, how it emerges in my body, and I try to expand that.

### ID: p41-14
A big part of staying sober has also been handling loss. A couple years ago, my ex-partner died from addiction. They weren't only my ex-partner, but they were one of my strongest recovery inspirations when I was in early sobriety. Together we founded the group that would later become Recovery Dharma NYC. I am still taking advice they shared when we were in each other's lives. And I'm heartbroken that the pull of escaping with substances overpowered their ability to take one of their own pieces of advice that they gave me after they started using again, "It's much easier to stay sober than to get sober." They told me they struggled with presenting as trans feminine in the world while sober — the frequent affronts of harassment, rage, rudeness, and microaggressions were heavy to handle.

### ID: p41-15
As a trans (masculine) person, I have experienced much of this myself, and I know that transphobia is amplified against trans feminine people. I'm also grateful that myself and many other trans and gender diverse people have found continued strength and clarity in sobriety and support from our practices and networks to keep going.

### ID: p41-16
"I love you, keep going." This is a metta phrase that was passed down from a Dharma teacher years back, one that appears often in my reflections. I, like all beings, am deserving of love, including my own love. It all starts there. I will persist and resist the narratives and attacks against trans people. Especially in this time when there is an intensely targeted political attack on our existence.

### ID: p41-17
I am training to face reality, and to see it for what it is. Here are some snapshots of my practice. Everyday, I sit down to meditate. Maybe it's 45 minutes, or 5 minutes, or somewhere in between. I heard a teacher once say that even just paying attention to 1 breath counts. After I meditate, I recite the Five Remembrances, or listen to monks chanting them in a video online.

### ID: p41-18
I am of the nature to grow old, there is no escaping growing old. I am of the nature to get sick, there is no escaping sickness. I am of the nature to die, there is no escaping death. Everyone and everything I love are of the nature to change, and there is no escaping separation from them. My actions are my only belongings, I cannot escape their consequences, they are the ground upon which I stand.

### ID: p41-19
Next I recite one round of classic metta phrases. I close my sit with taking refuge in the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha.

### ID: p41-20
I build on my daily sitting and life practice with residential practice periods. I do at least one 7-10 day silent meditation retreat per year (this year I did my first metta retreat, and it was incredibly fruitful), plus spend a week at a Thai Forest Buddhist Monastery. I'm grateful for the opportunities for these extended, dedicated practice periods, and believe that they have contributed immensely to expanding and strengthening wisdom, balance, and heartfulness.

### ID: p41-21
I'm still continuing to identify impermanence (anicca), ungovernability (anatta), and unsatisfactoriness (dukkha) and the ways in which I relate to them, and I don't doubt that these will be lifelong tasks. But I'm seeing them a lot more, and clearer, and this naturally has made recovery more attainable, and intoxication much less desirable. Escaping doesn't lead to lasting happiness, in fact in my experience, it just prolongs and sometimes solidifies whatever I'm trying to get away from. The benefits of being in touch with these three marks of existence are many — increased appreciation and presence, awareness of the vast webs and chains of interdependence, and a letting be of things being what I want and how I want them. Recovery Dharma has kept me rooted and rejoicing.

## Chapter 42: Synyi
Content Warning: Suicide

### ID: p42-1
I found Recovery Dharma during the lowest and most transformative time of my life. The popsicle sticks and glue that I used to contain my overwhelm and despair came crashing down around me. I'd later learn to refer to these popsicle sticks as substance use and process addictions, and that my overwhelm was rooted in untreated depression and trauma. Looking back on my recovery journey, I am grateful for the experience, learning, and healing, but it was hard-earned.

### ID: p42-2
My story starts in kindergarten, when I immigrated with my parents. Overnight, my world changed — a foreign place with a new language, knowing almost no one, a new school where I couldn't understand anybody, and my parents working all the time to survive. They did their best, but an asleep parent isn't a present parent, and I had to learn independence from a young age.

### ID: p42-3
I grew up seeing my parents model working hard, sacrificing their needs, acting strong, and never talking about feelings. I learned that my role in the family was to study hard, to not be a burden with my needs, push down my feelings, and that I needed to be happy so that their sacrifices were worth it.

### ID: p42-4
By high school, I'd been pushing down fears and insecurities for years. I was doing well in school, and that came with some self-worth and external validation, but I also felt so alone. The closer friendships I'd developed were always cut short by one of us moving away. So I entered high school with no real friends but luckily got adopted by an extrovert who I shared a geography class with.

### ID: p42-5
Finding some friends slowly built some confidence, but even in that circle, I felt like I was on the periphery, overthinking and worrying that I wasn't good enough, attractive enough, cool enough to have friends. But I got by, pushing down those insecurities. Later in high school, I found myself with people who had access to weed, and when I smoked, the incessant chatter in my mind cleared. I could be in on the secret and didn't have to worry about being uncool for once because everything was just hilarious instead.

### ID: p42-6
But when I was living my usual sober life as a straight-laced nerd, I was fraught with social anxiety and low self-esteem. The next times of my life were fueled by fear and external validation. I started to gain the external markers of success: I graduated top of my class, attracted romantic partners, got a coveted job, moved into a condo in the city. On the outside, things were great, but inside I was frightened constantly that the perfect facade would crack and everyone would see me as a fraud. I fell into coping mechanisms: working constantly and seeking perfection because if I was perfect then the fear of not being "good enough" felt a little less intense.

### ID: p42-7
On evenings to "treat myself" for the shitty life I put up with, I'd smoke weed from the moment I walked through the door until I eventually passed out in a smoke-filled oblivion, and every weekend was wake and bake. I was living only for the weekends, going to raves and festivals, taking party drugs and chasing the serotonin highs and feelings of connectedness that made me feel something other than the depression and anxiety that plagued my workdays. I started going to work high and my roommates and close friends started to tell me that they were worried about me. Honestly I was worried about me too.

### ID: p42-8
During a particularly stressful time at work, I went on vacation and came home wondering why I was staying in a job I hated. I'm fortunate that I had saved up some money, and so I quit without a job lined up and decided I was going to travel. Surely my location was the problem and if I traveled to beautiful destinations, then I would be happy. I was leaving on a trip to try to outrun my anxiety and depression, and maybe find some key to happiness because other solutions to stress, like mindfulness, hadn't worked for me.

### ID: p42-9
I now understand that with the unresolved trauma, my mind was a place that lacked self-compassion and my body felt unsafe when I sat still. It felt like such serendipity when I was struck by the idea that some people turn to religion in times of uncertainty and fear, so my desperation turned me to giving my parent's Buddhist religion a try. Up to this point, I had been an adamant atheist, though I always obeyed when my parents wanted me to go with them to the nearby Buddhist temple.

### ID: p42-10
I didn't understand why we lit incense, bowed three times in front of statues of deities I didn't recognize, and prayed with offerings for good things or for bad things not to happen. It all just seemed like illogical superstition to me. Now that I opened my mind to the idea of Buddhism, I learned about the Therada and Mahayana traditions in Southeast Asia, and they spoke to me so much more than my parents' practices. I searched online for a beginner intro to Buddhism and found Jetsunma Tenzin Palmo's book "Into the Heart of Life" and serendipitously again, her preface felt like it spoke directly to me as I was preparing for my trip. I highlighted a passage about how the mind is always with us, with its thoughts and fears from which we can never escape and so it makes sense to try and work with our mind so that it becomes a friendly travel companion for our journey through life.

### ID: p42-11
I dove into the book and became aware of the truth of impermanence and the truth of suffering. It resonated with me so deeply that the Buddha never demanded people to blindly follow his teachings, but instead encouraged them to observe for themselves and see that what he taught was true. And while impermanence and suffering made sense, I couldn't wrap my head around non-attachment or no-self, so I was determined to learn about it on my trip. That's how I ended up volunteering in Thailand, though I can't say I learned too much about these Buddhist concepts in Thailand because of the language barrier. However, I did meet some incredibly kind monks and laypeople.

### ID: p42-12
It was true though that no matter how far I went, my mind was always with me. It was telling me that I'm not good enough, that I'm weak since I burned out, and that I'm a broken depressed person who will never be happy if I couldn't even be perfectly happy while seeing these beautiful sights. I'm really glad to say that I have a much healthier relationship with my thoughts and emotions today with the help of lots of therapy, my recovery and Recovery Dharma, and my growing meditation practice.

### ID: p42-13
I eventually grew homesick and came home. I found a corporate job and started living with my now-spouse. We abused weed together every day, and as my job got more stressful, my weed use increased. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, I was a shell of a person, reclused into myself by overwhelm at work and even more overwhelm by basic things like going to the grocery store.

### ID: p42-14
I would later come to realize that the drastic shift in the world overnight as well as the panic about the unknown was emotionally triggering my trauma around immigrating at such a young age. I think I experienced emotional flashbacks of my terror and reverted to my kindergarten psychological capacity. Except this time, I had weed to abuse to try to quell the overwhelming panic. And it worked for a while, until it didn't anymore. I started down into the worst episode of depression I ever experienced — I lost interest in friends, hobbies, and my partner, and I shut down. It was really scary when I lost the ability to concentrate and my work performance declined, especially scary as someone whose self-worth came from work. As my overwhelm and terror grew, I turned to weed during the work day too and I hated myself for it. I entered a cycle of panic, using, feeling a few minutes of relief, and then hating myself for being weak for giving in to the craving.

### ID: p42-15
The height of my addiction, or my metaphorical bottom, came when I lost the will to live. My attempt on my life luckily ended with me in the emergency room. I was admitted to inpatient treatment and detoxed from marijuana while attending group therapy and learned the powerful feeling of connection when someone says "me too." I had started therapy about a year before, but because I was high all the time, I wasn't mindful of my thoughts and feelings outside of therapy sessions, so progress was slow. I left inpatient treatment with a waiting list spot for an outpatient program, a recommendation that I give up marijuana and attend psychologist follow-up sessions. I remember being told that depression was a three-pronged combination of bio, psycho, social, and that I would need to address bio with medication, psycho with therapy, and social by building up a mental well-being support system.

### ID: p42-16
For social support, I found my way to the rooms of Marijuana Anonymous where I heard other people telling stories that were similar to mine and it really helped me to stay off the weed. But the "singleness of purpose" tradition in 12-Step felt stifling because my problem wasn't only marijuana use, it was also the trauma I was unearthing in the "psycho" prong. Again I come back to serendipity. The Recovery Dharma program was exactly what I needed at the time. I received a suggestion to attend a second recovery meeting on a day that I had already been to an MA meeting, and curious, I went searching for alternatives.

### ID: p42-17
Through the Buddhist Recovery Network website, I found Recovery Dharma. When I visited the website, I was delighted to find that the Recovery Dharma book was readily available for free on the website, that it was accessible to me in my time of need. I devoured the book quickly — it helped me to frame my addiction in the teachings of the Buddha that I had already developed an interest in. Now revisiting the Dharma with my new lived experience of addiction, the truth of suffering took on new meaning.

### ID: p42-18
I found a sangha that met almost daily. And almost every day, I came and sat in meditation with like-minded travelers on the path. We could talk about anything, without the restrictions of "singleness of purpose." It was exactly what I needed because it helped me learn to meditate with the safety of a group, and I learned the language of talking about my trauma from reading the trauma-informed RD book, listening to shares, and practicing during my own shares.

### ID: p42-19
Today I feel like I'm thriving, not merely surviving. I've been sober from my "drug of no choice" for almost 3 years, and I've made great progress managing my process addictions of workaholism and perfectionism. I'm practicing real self love, gratitude, meditation, and validating my own feelings. My family, friends, and work are all going better than ever before. I can be present for my loved ones. I am able to take care of my darling cat and accept her love. I'm able to give back by hosting meetings in service of my sangha. I'm also blessed to be able to volunteer my professional skills as an RD Global Board Member and serve on Board committees.

### ID: p42-20
I have cultivated an understanding of myself, my trauma, triggers and coping mechanisms, so that I can weather the emotional storms when they come and give myself loving-kindness. There is hope and joy in my life, as well as strength and security in knowing that although I can't carpet the whole world, I can put on shoes as I continue my travels, with my healthier mind and spirit as my companion.
## Chapter 43: Matthew
Content Warning: Suicide

### ID: p43-1
One December morning, I made myself a cup of Folgers coffee and peered out the bars of my prison cell. My cellmate had gone to the yard and I had some time alone. Watching an armed guard walk past on the catwalk outside, I pondered life. "Why didn't anybody tell me it would hurt this much?" I asked myself. I was twenty-seven years old, recently sober, and barely two years into a fourteen year prison sentence. Things were actually getting better, though it was hard to see at the time.

### ID: p43-2
It hadn't always hurt that much. It had started out as fun. Growing up, there was always a case of cheap beer inside the fridge in the garage. It was there mostly for guests since neither of my parents really drank. I was eight years old the first time I stole one of those beers and drank it in the backyard. It was cold and crisp and left my tiny body feeling quite wonderful. I would remember it later.

### ID: p43-3
I was part of the "Just Say No" generation. My youth was filled with memories of DARE (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) classes, Nancy Reagan admonishments against drug use, and commercials with eggs crackling in a frying pan. I had ideas about what my brain would do on drugs.

### ID: p43-4
I was a curious kid with a natural distrust of authority. When I was told not to do something, I tended toward trying it at least once. Just to be sure. My attitude toward drugs was no different.

### ID: p43-5
At twelve, I tried weed. I'd stolen it from a babysitter and smoked it from a pipe made of tin foil. When none of the terrifying things that were promised me in DARE classes developed, I came to the erroneous conclusion that my parents, teachers, and First Lady had all been lying to me about drugs. Within short order, I was smoking pot with other latchkey kids, spending the hours after school and before our parents came home experimenting with our new form of entertainment. It was actually just fun.

### ID: p43-6
At thirteen years old, the fun started to subside. I was arrested at a school dance for possession of marijuana and was suspended for a week. I had always been a good kid and a good student. I'd never been in any serious trouble at school. This was a first for me.

### ID: p43-7
When I returned to school after my suspension, I swiftly realized that people treated me differently. I got attention from kids that normally wouldn't have paid me any mind. Teachers started treating me like an adult. I'd always been smart but too rough around the edges for the nerdy kids, and I'd always been too nerdy for the jockish crowd. Suddenly, I'd found a role that fit me: the smart kid with a wild streak. If the role didn't fit me well at first, I made sure that I fit myself into it.

### ID: p43-8
High school was a bit of a blur. Drug and alcohol use that started out as recreational transformed into daily ritual. Booze and weed eventually included hallucinogens. Cocaine and crank were added to the cocktail. Finally, I found crystal methamphetamine.

### ID: p43-9
I did meth for the first time during my senior year of high school. Something was different about this drug. I felt invincible, I felt like a god. I became a near-daily meth user from the start. Meth became a swift wrecking ball in my life. Within three months of use, I had dropped out of high school and was stealing as a way to support my habit.

### ID: p43-10
When I first started stealing, I tried to have some semblance of ethics about it, ridiculous as that sounds. I didn't steal from individuals. I didn't steal from cars. I didn't steal from homes. But my willingness to cross boundaries with stealing followed a similar progression as my willingness to try increasingly harder drugs, and I eventually found myself stealing whatever I could get my hands on. At eighteen, I was arrested for a string of burglaries and sentenced to more than five years in prison. I paroled at the legal age for drinking.

### ID: p43-11
During my time in county jail, in prison, and on parole, I was introduced to recovery. Twice, I stayed in 30-day residential treatment facilities and was exposed to 12-step programs. I went to meetings and superficially did what was asked of me. Even though it looked like I was in recovery, I wasn't actually doing recovery. My goal was not to stay sober but was, instead, to look good for parents, judges, and parole agents. Though I had decided that I would never use hard drugs like meth again, I had no designs on staying completely sober. I wanted to drink and smoke pot when life circumstances would allow for it.

### ID: p43-12
I started drinking again while I was on parole and, as soon as my state supervision ended, I resumed smoking pot. I used "successfully" like this for a couple of years. I was going to college and doing well. I had a great job. Relationships with family were mostly restored. I had nothing to be concerned about.

### ID: p43-13
Around this time, I took an Eastern Philosophy course in college and was introduced to the teachings of the Buddha. I read about the Four Noble Truths and the three characteristics of existence and felt a great sense of familiarity with them, like they represented a truth that I'd known all along but had somehow forgotten. I just knew the Dharma to be true but, at the same time, I decided that I wasn't suffering enough to worry about it just yet. I would get my chance.

### ID: p43-14
A couple of years after leaving prison, one of my closest childhood friends committed suicide in a very violent manner. It was the closest death had come in my life thus far and it shook me. I felt like the world was crumbling in on me, that I'd been emotionally and spiritually shaken from a foundation. I didn't know how to cope with the way I felt and I didn't have the inner resources to ask for help. I became a daily drinker and relapsed on methamphetamine a few months later.

### ID: p43-15
I started stealing again and my life snowballed in the same way it had seven years earlier. Overwhelmed with sadness, beset with remorse for the harm I was causing yet again, and burdened with shame at the thought of seeking help, I considered suicide but got loaded instead. An imperfect solution, the drugs saved me from myself.

### ID: p43-16
Yet again, I was arrested for a string of burglaries. I found myself facing centuries in prison under California's three strikes law. In the county jail and without the option of getting loaded, my suffering was inescapable. My sadness was inescapable. My remorse was inescapable. My shame, my suicidal ideation, everything, was inescapable. I was forced to look everything square in the face.

### ID: p43-17
There's a reason that the First Noble Truth is about suffering. No transformative path begins without it. Convinced that my life couldn't possibly get any worse than it was at the moment, I decided upon two things. First, I would try my hand at recovery. The worst thing that could happen was nothing. Second, recalling the Buddhism I'd encountered in college three years earlier, I'd give meditation and the Dharma a try.

### ID: p43-18
That was in 2005. There was no mindfulness or Buddhist-based recovery available, so finding recovery and following the Dharma started out as separate paths. On one hand, I started going to 12-step meetings in the county jail, found a sponsor on the streets, and began the process of writing inventories and making amends. On the other hand, I started meditating as best as I knew how. Without a teacher, the internet, or a sangha, I relied solely upon the books that family would generously send me.

### ID: p43-19
I completely misused meditation when I first started practice. Instead of using meditation as a method for meeting reality, I used it as an escape. In this way, meditation served as a substitute for the drugs I no longer had easy access to. I do not judge myself for using my practice this way in the beginning; in so many ways, it was exactly what I needed at the time. I would eventually develop the skills to face my reality more squarely, but it would take time.

### ID: p43-20
After a year and half in the county jail, I accepted a plea bargain of fourteen years in prison. By the time I arrived in Folsom State Prison later that year, I'd been clean from drugs and alcohol for nearly two years, I was prepared to start mentoring other incarcerated men in recovery, and my meditation practice was becoming consistent.

### ID: p43-21
At Folsom, I finally sat in meditation with other people. Two nights per week, I met with Sangha in the fabled Greystone Chapel. Facilitated by volunteers from the outside, these groups were where I really came to understand what mindfulness practice was about. I finally had fellows on the path, and I finally had teachers. Both were absolutely necessary to the flourishing of my meditation and dharma practice.

### ID: p43-22
Every afternoon during count, loud buzzers would sound off in the cell block. So, every afternoon, half an hour before count time, I rolled up a blanket and sat on the floor of my cell. The prison would be my timer. My meditation changed dramatically. No longer was it a method of escape; instead, it became a method of inquiry. In the beginning, it was simple. What was it like to breathe? What was it like to sit on my rolled-up blanket? What was the nature of the sounds in my cell block?

### ID: p43-23
With practice, I started to see that the present moment wasn't as bad as I thought it was. In fact, the present moment, when I wasn't actually thinking about it, was mostly neutral and oftentimes pleasant. This was a bit of a breakthrough for me, because some part of me was convinced that I was supposed to be miserable in prison.

### ID: p43-24
Yes, being in prison was awful. Yes, being away from friends and family was awful. Yes, washing my clothes in the toilet was awful. Yes, yes, yes. But, in time, I came to realize that these things were only awful insofar as I found myself mesmerized by my own narratives about them. My stories about my life were the problem, and I had a lot of them.

### ID: p43-25
Prison, I could not escape. There was no freedom from prison while I was living there. There was, however, freedom from my story about it. I did not have to take prison personally. This insight carried me through the remainder of my prison sentence and into the outside world.

### ID: p43-26
I paroled after seven years of incarceration. There was still no mindfulness or Buddhist-based recovery, so I continued to do in the free world what I had done inside: attend recovery meetings and meditation groups separately. Though I was immensely grateful for the recovery program I had, I nonetheless translated a great deal of the 12-step program into Buddhist terms and practices which better aligned with the way I moved through the world. Finally, after ten years of renunciation from drugs and alcohol, a Buddhist-based path of recovery was developed and I helped to establish it in my local area. This program eventually became the Recovery Dharma of today. I no longer needed to translate my program of recovery.

### ID: p43-27
Since coming home, I have found that six things have been integral to my continued growth in recovery and as a human being. Meditation. Meetings. Study. Service. Friends. Teachers.

### ID: p43-28
I meditate every day and try to participate in a minimum of two silent retreats every year. I regularly attend recovery meetings and other Buddhist meditation groups. I study the teachings of the Buddha in order to develop a deeper understanding of ways to implement them in my life. I take on service positions in my Recovery Dharma groups and share the message of recovery and of the Dharma wherever I can. I maintain friendships with people who nurture and support my own growth. I regularly meet with both a mentor and a Buddhist teacher in order to navigate difficulties in practice and continue to move forward on the path.

### ID: p43-29
My life has been both challenging and beautiful since coming home from prison more than a decade ago.

### ID: p43-30
I have completed state supervision and graduated from university. I have completed a five-year trade apprenticeship and become an elected union official. I have gotten married to a wonderful woman in recovery and become a homeowner. I've traveled to Buddhist pilgrimage sites in India and participated in extended meditation retreats at home and abroad. I have received lay ordination within a Buddhist tradition and started teaching the Dharma to people in California prisons.

### ID: p43-31
I have also navigated complex PTSD and started to unlearn prison survival strategies that were no longer useful to me. I have been present for death when it sweeps through and survived life-altering heart surgery.

### ID: p43-32
Mindfulness, heartfulness, and community are what made and continue to make all of these possible. As one of my teachers has said, Dharma practice has the capacity to transform the very nature of suffering. Awakening might not come in the form of sudden moments of revelation, but instead may entail the gradual digestion of pain and trauma. Over the years, I have progressively come to see the good that has come from past suffering and I try my best to carry that perspective in the present moment, reshaping it with wisdom and love. One line from Recovery Dharma's dedication of merit stands out to me: "As we have learned from practice, great pain does not erase goodness, but in fact informs it." This isn't just a platitude. It's a promise.

Content Warning: Childhood sex abuse

### ID: p44-1
My story shows how a person can go from real hardship to a life of balance using community, prayer, the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path. Trauma made me want to numb myself with substances and my practice has allowed me to feel those feelings from the past without reaching out to something to harm myself further.

### ID: p44-2
My childhood was pretty rough. I was raised by a woman who was a sex worker and when I turned eleven years old, she started to traffic me as well. I learned to leave my body and disassociate because that was the only way I could deal with it. I lived that way for a long time. My mother didn't allow us to play with other children of color. We would get beatings for that even though she was dark; a "Morena" herself. Eventually, I was placed in a children's mental institution because I stopped talking. I was there for a couple years before they sent me back to my mother.

### ID: p44-3
When I got home, one of my abusers was visiting my mother so I ran away the first day I came back. As soon as I saw him at the top of the steps, I took off. There was a local delivery boy who I liked and he let me hang out at his apartment while he was working. I told him I didn't want to go back home and about what was going on there. He told me that when he came back from work he would have something for me and that ended up being a bottle. I took that first drink and it felt like, my God, where have you been. Everything disappeared from my mind. I just wanted to have fun. I was giggly for the first time in a very long time.

### ID: p44-4
I had stopped going to school during the third grade. There were no social services at the time; at least for my neighborhood. You didn't see them unless the school complained. I was in and out of juvenile detention and one female lawyer told me I was inappropriately dressed for court and gave me her own stockings to wear for the proceedings. I wanted to stay with her because she was nice to me.

### ID: p44-5
At fifteen, I was emancipated from my mother and began working at a bar. This older lady I met on the bus asked me if I wanted to work. I thought it was going to be cleaning houses or something but when I asked her what she wanted me to do she told me about the bar. The first day I went in for the interview, I had never been inside a bar before and they were putting all these shot glasses in front of me and I asked the lady, Miss. Mary, what the shot glasses were for. She told me eagerly that men were buying me drinks. Since I didn't like the taste of alcohol, she taught me how to make a lemon drop chaser with a slice of lemon covered in sugar. I got hooked on those. I drank for the sensation. I got myself ready for drinks, it was a treat. This was in 1970 at the Golden Slipper on Webster Avenue in the Bronx.

### ID: p44-6
Eventually I found out the go-go dancers at the bar made a lot more money than I did, so I started doing that. I liked it because I didn't actually have to get involved with the men, it was all an illusion. I go-go danced for nine years and made a lot of money. I worked long hours at different places around the city and I drank through all of it. I didn't know that I had crossed that invisible line of addiction. I would isolate and drink, I didn't want to share my drink, I would get territorial with my alcohol. I would keep cups of alcohol around my apartment in different rooms, one in the bathroom next to the toothbrush, one next to the bed which I would reach for as soon as I woke up in the morning.

I gave birth to my daughter when I was almost eighteen. My mother took her because it was either sign her over to my mother or release her to the system. I didn't raise her myself because I couldn't stay with my mother, and I thought that at least I could still see her if she's with family.

I met my husband in the neighborhood. We went to a party together and he came home with me and never left. When I met him he was sniffing heroin and drinking but I made him stop the heroin. He said if I stopped dancing he would marry me the next year. We had a son and, when he was three, my husband wanted us to move to Virginia because his family was down there. We both got jobs, he did maintenance, I cleaned houses. He started getting abusive to the point where I would check into a psych ward for the weekend just to get away from him for a while. I applied for a job at the Department of Corrections (DOC) and he hid the acceptance letter from me under the mattress. He didn't want me making more money because he wouldn't have as much control over me.

### ID: p44-9
In May 1990, I received my first paycheck from the DOC, and I got my own apartment. I put up bunk beds and gave my son the bedroom while I slept out in the living room on a daybed.

### ID: p44-10
During my second or third year at the DOC, I went to a party with fellow officer and they had a lot of coke, so me and another girl went into the kitchen and started cooking it. At the time it was called "freebasing". Before I left the party that night, I was addicted. I ultimately stopped using crack because of my son. I went to my Major and told her I had a problem, and they sent me to rehab.

### ID: p44-11
I was sober for a long time until I met Keena working a temp job at Great Adventure. We figured out a scam where we could pocket ticket money directly, and one day we made $1,500 each. Keena wanted to score drugs with the money, and I told her I would have just a little bit, but we were up all night long. That's when it started up again. We moved up to New Jersey together with my son because he had gotten kicked out of high school in Virginia. He didn't want me to be with Keena, and so he moved out, which hurt me. He felt like I picked her over him, but I felt like my personal relationships were none of his business.

### ID: p44-12
I started having feelings for women when I started dancing but I didn't take it seriously until later. My son knew that I was gay. I had met another woman previously and we were "married"; it's not like it is today, so we had what was called a "holy union". The ceremony took place at a gay church and the pastor asked us what colors we were using in our wedding and we told him purple and silver. He wore purple and silver vestments for our ceremony. She was always good to me. Even after we broke up she helped me raise my son, and they're still in touch to this day. She helped me pay rent and got me a new truck, but all that stopped once Keena came into my life.

### ID: p44-13
Keena and I would argue over who did more of the drugs. I tried to solve our problems by moving, but as soon as we set foot in our new town she was out looking for drugs again. I found a job working for an elderly lady, and she had two large pickle jars full of quarters at her home, and Keena went in there and stole all that lady's money. And of course I got fired. One day when Keena didn't come home, I called Catholic Charities and they put me in a hotel and got me a ticket out of there. Something told me to not look back or say goodbye or nothing. I was so concerned with getting away from her I didn't notice the days and months of sobriety stacking up.

### ID: p44-14
Eventually I came back to New York and started hanging out with the wrong people and picked up crack again; it was something familiar. I lost my apartment and found myself living in an abandoned building with a bunch of other drug users. I moved to a shelter which is where I attended my first 12-step meeting. I went to so many meetings that the facilitator told me I was ready for a meeting outside the shelter. It was on Broadway between 106th and 107th street. That became my home group and the shelter found me an apartment and I moved back to the Bronx. 12-step showed me that I was my own worst enemy and that the only reason I am where I am today is for the grace of God. He was my rehab, for real. He keeps it simple for me.

### ID: p44-15
It still felt like I needed something else; like something was missing. I was surfing the net one day during the height of the 2020 pandemic and I found Recovery Dharma and went to an online meeting. The spirituality of it was very attractive to me. Even though I was new to this type of fellowship, when people spoke I really identified with what they were saying. I asked about a sponsor, or in this case, a mentor, and they hooked me up with another woman who was also living in the Bronx.

### ID: p44-16
I feel safe to tell my whole story in RD because its consideration of people's trauma is part of the practice. I've gone to quite a few different RD meetings and they all have had the same calm energy, I think of it as Buddha energy. There can be tears in meetings and there's no shame. RD is a safe space and I needed that type of energy in my life. 12-steps was the opening, but now there are different and deeper dimensions of recovery, and RD did that for me.

### ID: p44-17
One thing our practice has helped me with is my reactivity. Because of my daily meditation practice and the teachings of the Four Noble Truths and Eightfold Path, I can take a pause before reacting to something that makes me angry. I am still a work in progress, but I know that I'm not in the street anymore and I don't have to protect myself like that. The wise one says to listen and be still. I know I'm getting better because someone said something unwise to me the other day, and I didn't say anything, I just gave them a look over my glasses.

### ID: p44-18
Recovery Dharma has helped me have compassion for myself and others. This has helped me receive love and care from other people, something I haven't been used to. While I don't live the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path perfectly, I strive to. I pray for that. I meditate every morning with a wise friend and lately I've been using healing meditations because I have chronic pain and it's been helpful.

### ID: p44-19
Please don't let me leave you with the impression that this practice is easy because it's not. I used to avoid feeling and now I feel everything. I've learned that when stuff comes up I just let it play out. Sometimes you need to just let the record play. I have a record that was chiseled into my body and there's nothing I can do about that but I try and catch the feelings so I can identify if they're from past or present, if it's guilt or shame. When my past pain haunts me I stop and breath slowly and chant my favorite mantra: Om tare tuttare ture soha.
## Chapter 45: Jean

### ID: p45-1
I started drinking at age eight and within a few years, I was an expert on French wines. My father had died in a plane crash when I was four, I'd recovered from a serious bout of spinal meningitis that same year (leaving me with lifelong learning disabilities), and my mom acquired a female lover when I was six. So, really, why not turn to drinking? My drinking accelerated my senior year in high school, which became one long alcoholic blur. I was accepted to college in October of that year, so not a lot was required of me other than to be upright from time to time. My attraction to other girls was starting to emerge, and I drank in part to fit in, but mostly to numb those feelings.

### ID: p45-2
College took me to the University of Colorado-Boulder in 1969. Please feel free to close your eyes and imagine just how crazy that time was. Pure LSD, incredible leaf, psilocybin, 3.2 beer — we had it all plus a healthy dose of campus revolution. I'd gone from high school in a small town in New Hampshire to an epicenter of the zeitgeist. I was completely unprepared and found an immediate escape in drugs and alcohol. My grades suffered and eventually I dropped out. I did finally own my sexuality and found a short-lived romantic relationship that set the stage for the series of loving, albeit disastrous relationships to come.

### ID: p45-3
At 26, I left behind an epically poor performance as a teacher of kids with developmental disabilities and headed to Arcosanti, a visionary architectural and environmental project emerging in the Arizona desert. Armed with an unemployment paycheck from the state of Illinois and no construction skills whatsoever, I became a dishwasher, rebar manager, electrician, bronze foundry worker, and community networker. In my spare time, I was (of course) a village bartender and drug supplier. At Arcosanti, I found both my purpose and my people. We were a bunch of misfits and idealists, a clown car come to life on a daily basis.

### ID: p45-4
My partner at the time and I left Arcosanti in 1980 with everything we owned in our VW Bug. We landed in Cambridge, Massachusetts and started focusing on work and school. I became a daily blackout drinker, sexually promiscuous and emotionally abusive. I hated myself and I still didn't stop. Finally, the relationship ended and my former partner stopped any form of communication with me for 13 years. I had earned every one of those years.

### ID: p45-5
My last drink was Nyquil on July 4, 1986. Or at least I think it was 1986. It's been a while. But I'm sure it was July 4th, I was lonely, in somebody else's house and looking for some kind of relief from anything at all. I'd been to a few 12-step meetings but thoroughly resisted the idea that I belonged with people who couldn't handle their drinking. That just seemed ridiculous to me, and evidence of a complete failure of will. But I woke up on July 5th and took in the reality that I'd been reduced to someone who drank Nyquil to get high. At that moment, I lost any interest in drinking again and it never came back. I'd lost almost everything: my partner, my home, my self-respect. I literally had no options but to start building a sense of self and doing the work to begin living with integrity, self-respect, and care.

### ID: p45-6
I trundled along with the 12-steps for many years. I did all the stuff — 90 meetings in 90 days, sponsors, social life built around people I'd met in Alcoholics Anonymous, learning to make really bad coffee in church basements, and turning my life over to, well, what? My standing 12-step joke is that I never drank again because I didn't have the energy to get sober again. I tried everything to get my mind around the idea of a higher power, whether that meant the group, the table, or some other random object.

### ID: p45-7
One night, seven years into all of this, I was at a meeting and someone from out of town dropped in. She started talking about the spirit within and the concept of being spirited — honoring and cherishing that quality of spiritedness. I never saw her again, but that night I quit pondering the meaning of higher power and started owning my spiritedness. From that day forward, I became a person in recovery.

### ID: p45-8
It took a few more years to conduct "a searching and fearless moral inventory" because language like that makes me want to hide under the bed, not actually do anything self-reflective. But one afternoon while treading water in a pool in Bethesda, Maryland, I downloaded all my sins to a very nice woman who was serving as my sponsor and she let me know that I'd "got off easy." My track record didn't feel easy to me, but her saying that in such a kind and generous way gave me the emotional space to keep going in recovery.

### ID: p45-9
This same sponsor encouraged me to get inpatient treatment for the history of alcoholism in my family (I'm a third-generation alcoholic). I spent a week at a facility that uses psychodrama and other intense group-oriented therapeutic tools to dig into the mess that was my family and get an understanding of how to end the destructive patterns I had absorbed as a child. I left there feeling free for the first time in my life.

### ID: p45-10
Not surprisingly, it was during this period, at about 12 years sober, that I met the woman, Anna, who I'd go on to marry and live with for 24 years.

### ID: p45-11
Several years into our relationship, Anna and I started looking for meditation teachers. We spent numerous weekends at Breitenbush, our local retreat center in the Oregon Cascades, field-testing various specimens. Some of them were boring, some authentically annoying, and some bordering on creepy. I'd seen Noah Levine's profile in the Breitenbush brochure for several years; he looked a little dangerous but interesting so we signed up for a week with him one summer. Within an hour of listening to him, Anna and I looked at each other and knew we'd found our teacher. Noah's practice community was based in Los Angeles, with Against The Stream serving as his hub organization.

### ID: p45-12
I embraced Dharma with a vengeance. I did retreats, listened to endless podcasts by Theravadan teachers such as John Peacock, Christina Feldman, Gil Fronsdal and others. Noah offered a yearlong book study course co-taught by Mathew Brensilver and so we made the quarterly trek to Los Angeles. I went to Noah's Against The Stream events and loved both the practice and the community. I was initially not excited about Refuge Recovery, the Buddhist-adjacent recovery program Noah developed with community members from Against The Stream, but eventually came around to the idea of a Buddhist-based program that flipped the disease model of alcoholism on its tiny little head. Refuge Recovery annual conferences were a celebration of resilience and hope. The community was thriving and, a couple of years in, I took over from Dave Smith as Executive Director. 12-Step saved my life, Dharma study and practice gave me a life worth living.

### ID: p45-13
I'd heard Noah say that "sooner or later you will lose everything" but I didn't think it would ever apply to Against The Stream. But that's exactly what happened. Things fell apart and some handled it skillfully, and some did not. Along with Amy, Dirk, Dan, Don, Gary, Jessica, Matthew, and Paul (and countless others), we started building Recovery Dharma. We wanted to be intentional in our framework — it had to be peer-led and trauma-informed. It had to have a book that was driven by Dharma. A volunteer from Austin put together a website for us in a week. We were intense and focused and more than a little obsessed. Even though the reality of the need for Recovery Dharma came at much personal loss for some of us, building Recovery Dharma was almost always pure joy and a whole lot of anarchy. I'll never forget the day Paul went live with the Facebook page; he was in Vermont and I was in Oregon and we were texting each other nonstop as the numbers grew. Recovery Dharma was driven by love, not always perfect but always steadfast. I am humbled to witness the growth of our program and all of the people who have put so much faith and care into it. We now have over 10,000 people in our main Facebook group and new folks are stepping in every day to be of service. RD has grown from the same five people doing everything to the point that I don't know half the Board nor most of our Facebook administrators. It's incredibly gratifying to see our program unfold in such an authentic and inspiring way.

### ID: p45-14
At 36 or so years into recovery, I continue to enjoy the benefits of the Three Jewels — Buddha, Dharma and Sangha. Dharma teachings and sangha have enabled me to look at each day as an opportunity to live with intention and compassion. I've experienced the 10,000 joys and the 10,000 sorrows in recovery, and Dharma practice has helped me navigate it all with some measure of self-compassion and equanimity. Impermanence is a part of life and the work I've done has enabled me to navigate it while acknowledging the suffering it can bring. I'm at Arcosanti as I write this, wind bells and birds everywhere. I'm not sure what life is going to bring next but I feel hopeful that Dharma study and practice will give me the "strong back and soft front" taught by Zen Buddhist Roshi Joan Halifax. Recovery is for the fearless amongst us who are equally willing to explore the tenderness and vulnerability of the human experience. Experiencing recovery in community has given me a sense of wholeness and love that I couldn't have found on my own. I am indebted to all who share their practice and gifts in our sangha.
## Chapter 46: Destiny

### ID: p46-1
My brain has blocked out a lot of memories from early childhood. I suppose this repression is some sort of self-defense mechanism. What I do remember is feeling isolated. I never really had much emotional support. For most of my life, my mom has struggled with drug addiction and my dad has been in prison. My mom and I lived with my grandparents in a small town in the middle of nowhere. It was a home riddled with dysfunction and codependency. Because I lacked understanding of the world and coping skills, I thought I was inadequate and incapable of dealing with life. I remember feeling forgotten, overlooked, alone, and scared.

### ID: p46-2
The town we lived in was predominantly Caucasian and partially racist. I am biracial and I struggled to fit in the small country town. I felt like I was too Black for the white kids and too white for the Black kids. I was also very creative, diverse, and a little eccentric. All the other kids in my school had little cliques, but I never felt genuinely included. By 6th grade, I was self-harming to feel "in-control" of my pain. After having an emotional episode in late middle school, I was prescribed Xanax for a short period. For the first time in my life, I felt like I could disconnect from my harsh reality and relax in my own skin. After the doctor cut me off, I continually found other ways to get Xanax.

### ID: p46-3
In high school, I became friends with another attractive outcast who liked to use pills, marijuana, and alcohol just as much as me. She was my partner in crime. For once, I felt seen and understood. I also started getting into toxic relationships as I searched for love, attention, and affection in all the wrong places. Even though I got good grades, I skipped so much school that I had to drop out; I got my GED shortly after. After turning 19, I went to a strip club where I found myself inspired by a dancer and infatuated with the lifestyle. Being an exotic dancer was like being a comedian, therapist, and actress simultaneously. My regulars loved me because I would listen deeply to them.

### ID: p46-4
At the same time, my intentions were insincere. I only listened to them with the condition of being paid for my time. For the most part, the relationships with my customers were artificial and developed through manipulation. But ultimately the person I hurt the most was myself. I was getting deeper and deeper into my drug addiction. I was also addicted to the fast-paced lifestyle and external validation. I was modeling too, and I became attached to the idea I was only worthy if I was desired by others. I was also in a very long and unhealthy relationship with a person who abused me physically and emotionally.

### ID: p46-5
Eventually, I went to jail a couple times for possession. One time was on the 4th of July. I remember watching the fireworks in the county jail through a tiny window behind the bars of my cell. "How ironic," I thought to myself. Later that night, I started going through withdrawals. In the holding cell, another inmate told me that I was an addict and needed to get help. As my mind spun out and my body shut down, it honestly never occurred to me that she might be right. When my abusive relationship ended, I spiraled deeper into addiction. To avoid feeling alone and unwanted, I latched onto a young man I found attractive. We went to a flop house one day looking for drugs. I looked around at the squalor the squatters were living in. How could they live like this? It looked like it had never been cleaned and someone had ripped all the wires out of the walls. However, after my first hit of meth moments later, I moved in with them, and I didn't leave for a while. I was waitressing at the strip club, so I had plenty of money to support my habit. I lost 60 pounds in two months. I also temporarily lost my mind.

### ID: p46-6
At the time I went to my first 12-step meeting, I was back at my grandparents, with no bedroom to call my own, and pregnant. The meetings were the only place that I felt safe. I finally started to gain some understanding about my addiction. I would go to the meetings and just word vomit while sharing around the tables. After relating to other members, I was desperate to turn my life around, so I cast a magic spell for a new beginning. The universe must have had a sense of humor because it promptly burned my grandma's house down. We lost everything.

### ID: p46-7
In some ways though, it was the best thing that could have happened. I relapsed very briefly and went back to meetings where I got a sponsor and started working the steps for my first time. I made a promise to myself. I decided to dedicate my life to healing myself and others. I vowed to be there for my daughter when she was born.

### ID: p46-8
I completed my court ordered probation and monitoring. Then, around eight months into my recovery, after giving birth to my daughter and getting custody of my younger sister, I tried to go to my mom's apartment to take her some groceries. My mom was still using. Her apartment was a mess with squatters coming and going. The scene was permeated with utter despair. Yet, I remember feeling jealous of her — that she could live like this "without a care." I had a brief relapse a couple days later. The vivid image of my mother in those deplorable conditions was a wound that I could not hold space for.

### ID: p46-9
I recommitted to healing. I had finally realized I wanted out of the self-destructive cycle of addiction. I sought help from a therapist. I went back to the 12-step meetings. I reconnected with my sponsor. Additionally, I began meditating and learning to sit with myself.

### ID: p46-10
I used to say my addiction was preying on me, telling my lies. Had I been more aware, I would have been able to identify that scene for what it really was — misery. I would have been able to understand that I was not seeing clearly. Awareness would have allowed me to better understand reality, to reach out to someone for help, and to be there for myself instead of turning on myself and running from the discomfort. Awareness could have saved me from shooting that painful second arrow.

### ID: p46-11
Soon, I would gain new awareness and understanding through the addition of Recovery Dharma to my program. During the COVID-19 pandemic, I started attending RD meetings online. I found this sangha in Birmingham, Alabama that was hosting multiple meetings a week. I quickly became a regular and beloved member of the sangha even though I lived thousands of miles away. I cultivated a network of wise friends who I could check in with and talk to when I felt emotionally distressed.

### ID: p46-12
The RD program made me a more self-compassionate person as well as a more mindful mother and friend. Meditation really changed my life for the better. I find it interesting whenever I see where my mind has gone. Sometimes I laugh at myself. I can focus on the sound of my breath or where I feel the sensation of breath the most. I can label my thoughts as thinking, reminding myself "Oh, this is my critical mind", and letting the thoughts pass naturally like a cloud passing over me through a bright blue sky.

### ID: p46-13
My practice has taught me that — no matter how distressed I become — I can always return to concentrating on my breath. I can take a sacred pause. I can create a safe space for my mind by focusing on my breath. I used to feel mentally agitated and unstable, but now I can soothe my nervous system. I can use wise concentration to choose what to focus on. I do not have to label things "bad" or "good." I do not have to fixate on anything. I can concentrate on my physical sensations and release the stories.

### ID: p46-14
I still honor my truth by gently accepting my feelings and not trying to change them in any way. I also practice not becoming hypnotized by the stories I tell myself. When I experience racing thoughts, I try to remember to pause before acting so I can engage with others more skillfully. I try to engage with myself more skillfully too. I talk to myself kindly, write myself love letters, and listen to affirmations relative to my mood. I try to remember that I am human, and I can accept the ebbs and flows of this experience.

### ID: p46-15
I am intentional with my time now. I wake up early so I can meditate and do my rituals before my daughter wakes up. I love trying new meditations and sampling different spiritual practices. Whenever I do a mindless activity like scrolling on social media, even if for a duration as short as three minutes, I start to feel like a zombie. I can hear my wiser self saying, "Put the phone down." In these instances, I can practice mindfulness by listening to my wiser self and intuition that disconnecting is not serving me.

### ID: p46-16
I still get stressed. I am a single mother and going to school. I have learned to reach out to others when I feel overwhelmed. I consistently confide in my wise friends, my sponsor, and my therapist. I try to get their perspective on a difficult or confusing situation before speaking or acting. Another thing I do is check if I am hungry, angry, lonely, or tired before coming to conclusions. I also use breathwork, ASMR, and binaural beats to calm my nervous system and aid my brain in relaxing. I am a bit of a perfectionist. But, when I find I am being too hard on myself, I remember to breathe and smile at the inner critic when she makes an appearance. The breath creates space in my mind and heart. After calming down, I can ask myself if I am seeing clearly or through filters created in the past (i.e. trauma or learned harmful thinking patterns). I can name the unhelpful additional information as stories and remember that they are contributing to my suffering by adding more confusion.

### ID: p46-17
Today, I feel empowered. I try to be present in every aspect of my life. As a single parent and the legal guardian of my sister, I endeavor to never "check out" and I try to treat my girls with respect and gentleness. I seek out information to understand where they are developmentally so I can have wise understanding of their capacity. I try to remember the basic goodness in people. I recognize that each person is dealing with their own complications, which are causing them to react in habitual ways.

### ID: p46-18
Since I have found Recovery Dharma, I have also been able to help others with their recovery. And I can do this because I now sincerely know that I no longer doubt my own ability to recover. I have become confident that this journey of lifelong growth is the path I was meant to walk. I will continue to dedicate my life to my personal evolution and healing, and I will keep spreading love and light endlessly.

### ID: p46-19
My goal is to leave every moment better than I found it. Anything that passes by me will experience my love.
## Chapter 47: Ned

### ID: p47-1
About seven years ago my administrative assistant told me that I had an urgent call from my significant other. I stopped typing on my computer and grabbed the phone. My partner, Victor, did not wait for me to say hello. "There's someone here at the house from the water company telling me he is turning off our water service!" he shouted into the phone. What? I thought for a minute. I owned the house, lived there with Victor for about thirteen years, was a partner in a prestigious law firm, had all the outward appearances of a successful attorney, and yet my $100 water bill that was 60 days overdue. I had Victor put the guy on the phone and begged him to stop and take a credit card for payment. He said all right. I flipped through my wallet looking for a credit card that still had $100 available and took my best guess. It worked. No water shutoff. Lucky me? Not so much.

### ID: p47-2
How did life get to that chaotic point? Well, I was in a ten-year "relapse" after abstaining from gambling. I had been clean for twelve years at one point, then went back out, and stopped and started in spurts and fits…. until I just gambled until I couldn't gamble anymore. In 12-step recovery I always disliked the term "slip," as I believed the central theme of Gambler's Anonymous — the desire to stop gambling — was the most crucial requirement to progress into recovery. I knew I didn't "slip." Rather, over a period of several years of not working any program, I had lost the desire to abstain. Once that desire was gone, I felt no barriers and reentered the gambling arena with a vengeance.

### ID: p47-3
The compulsion took over my life, as I started to spend more time at local casinos than at my law office. I went before work. I went after work. Initially, I brought a limited amount of cash with me sufficient to "play" for a while and left when it was gone. If I won, I might leave with some winnings, but returned within days to gamble away the winnings and more. Over the period of about five years, I depleted my checking and savings accounts, drew down most of my retirement accounts (for which I still owe taxes on to this day, and worse, had to borrow against my house (which I eventually had to sell to get out of the large mortgage payments), used other people's money (which caused massive shame and self-loathing), and had to borrow from payday lenders against my cars (which were old and needed to be replaced in the first place).

### ID: p47-4
Gamblers learn as I did that it is not just about the lost money. We lose time. We lose focus, perspective, integrity, and drive. Our primary relationships falter. Our family and friends can sense that there is a hidden problem even if they don't become fully aware of the real problem. Our actions poison relationships with family, friends and colleagues. I experienced all these losses. Victor no longer trusted me. I rarely came home until the sun was coming up and he was leaving for his job. I was short-tempered. I was in that mode where one only looks at everything or every person in their life as a means to get something else. For me, that was to get money to gamble and to somehow survive until I could gamble again.

### ID: p47-5
During most of my life, I was active in the LGBTQ and Jewish communities, my legal profession, community service, and in health and education charities. Losing the drive, focus, time, and resources that I used to bring to this work resulted in it all but evaporating from my life. My creative outlets in hobbies such as photography, cooking, writing, and music also dried up. Instead, I spent the majority of my days figuring out the minimum things that I needed to do to just "get by" at work and in life and then spent the rest of the day gambling, figuring out how to get more money to gamble, how to cover the increasing dangers from maxed-out credit cards, NSF checks, and ridiculously high cost payday loans. I had to sell assets or let them go, such as a timeshare which I could no longer pay the yearly maintenance, and some artwork I had managed to collect over the years. I canceled vacations. I canceled home services. Victor picked up the slack around the house but not without just-cause for multiple resentments. In sum, everything I had worked on and for over the years — a stable relationship, a successful workplace, community engagement and a reputation for integrity, were all crumbling under the weight of my insatiable compulsion to gamble.

### ID: p47-6
When I look back at the chaos and suffering during the days in my active addiction, I am most cognizant of my loss of choices. It often felt like my car simply took me to the casino after work. My ability to make wise or safe choices was completely obliterated. The tentacles of my addictive cravings wrapped around every nook and cranny of my brain until I became focused on one thing…gambling, or as its often called, "staying in action."

### ID: p47-7
I somehow had a block against going back to my 12-step program after all those years "in action." I was not wanting to hear judgmental and directive comments, whether well intended or otherwise, from the GA members that I would encounter. Instead I turned to a recommended therapist who specialized in addiction. Among the helpful advice I received from him was that I try a program that he was aware of that was based on Buddhist principles in lieu of the traditional 12-step approach. I followed his advice and never looked back. At Recovery Dharma, I found a non-judgmental space where I could make changes and have a unique and empowered recovery experience.

Through my time in Buddhist recovery programs, and most actively and consistently in Recovery Dharma, I have learned that I DO have choices. I can choose how I act in the face of stress, disappointment, and even happiness. Developing a meditation practice, attending and chairing meetings, writing detailed inquiries, meeting with sangha members outside meetings to share our experiences — have all been key components in finding a better way to live. Learning the difference between feelings and emotions on one hand, and wise action on the other, changed everything for me. It opened me up to change my conduct and choose the compassionate or loving response to tough situations. Along with seeking forgiveness from those I harmed, learning how to act compassionately and practice forgiveness — of myself and others — are key lessons I have gained from working through the path suggested by RD.

It is not magic. It is not instantaneous. It takes work. For an addict, that is very frustrating. We want things right now. I was in active gambling addiction in the last round for about fifteen years, and yet I expected the cleanup would take a year or two. How many journeys work like that? Experiencing the length of time it is taking for me to dig out much of the mess that I created through my own actions is one of the hardest but most important lessons I have learned. Not letting that ongoing experience follow me like a cloud is also part of the learning. Letting go of "what was" and living in "what is" has been key to improving my life. And so if it takes longer than I hoped to get right again, I have also learned to let go of the idea of instantly getting my old life "back."

### ID: p47-10
A compulsive gambler always thinks about "getting it back." The next bet, the next machine, the next deal, the next hand… always beckon with a mysterious allure of an instant fix. That unreal imagery is not for me anymore.

### ID: p47-11
Today I try to live in the present, in the day, in the meeting, in the concert — in the moment. I make sure that I am mindful of what is happening and how I am experiencing it right at that moment. I double check with myself and sift through emotions and feelings to understand how they inform what might be my most constructive or compassionate reaction. I ask myself what is the wisest response in light of these considerations. The issues do not have to be monumental — they can be as everyday as how I consciously respond to a rude sales clerk to the response I provide to an employee that delivers a disappointing performance on an assigned project. Working through situations with the ability to provide a considered response over a knee-jerk reaction provides a much more satisfying and peaceful way to live.

### ID: p47-12
Certain other key concepts from RD enhance the path forward. Service has been key in my recovery, from starting meetings to helping other members with their projects. Sangha has also been important. The connections we make through service and activity within a sangha create a web of protection based on a couple of important attributes that we rarely experience during active addiction: trust and honesty! We learn that we can have relationships based on these qualities outside of the sangha too. Life does get better. Slow progress is always better than a slide backwards because there is no guarantee that we can overcome the next low.

### ID: p47-13
Finally, the RD program and our recoveries rest on our reaching out when we feel vulnerable. It is not easy for an addict, as we spend so much of our active addiction making sure we don't need anyone else and certainly never showing our vulnerability. I have learned that reaching out for help is a crucial part of the transformation from being lost to following the path. It feels risky, but it's proven less risky for me than a spin of a wheel or the turn of a card. The journey on which I find myself today through RD is one of positive transformation. I hope you start or continue your individual journey and follow your own path toward a better life. The RD program is here for you. Reach out.
## Chapter 48: Kara

### ID: p48-1
At about age six, I realized I was different than my family and people around me. I often felt like I was in the wrong family because it appeared from their reactions that no one thought or felt like I did. My experience was that I was either too much or not enough. Due to the discomfort that arose from being me, I found my first solace in imagination and day-dreaming. Escaping my reality to a world I imagined was my first "drug of choice." In that world, I was accepted, included, and belonged.

### ID: p48-2
My heart ached to find others like me. My ears perked when I heard about a far-removed cousin or aunt who was in trouble with drugs. I didn't know much about this, but I was intrigued by the hush of whispering, the "danger" that loomed in bits and pieces of stories I heard. I did not have relationships with these extended family members, but I knew in my heart that somehow, I was like them. The outcasts, the rebels, the creative beings whose emotions and thoughts were so big. I knew that if I could meet them, we would have some unsaid bond. My home was a middle-class Italian-Irish household. My father worked various tech jobs while my mother stayed home to tend to us children. When dad returned home from work, he would have a beer or two. Wine was served at dinner with guests and liquor on special occasions. I detested the smell and had no interest in alcohol or cigarettes, which in the 1980s it seemed everyone smoked and smoked everywhere!

### ID: p48-3
However, at the age of fourteen, the perception of being left out, of not belonging, of criticism for being myself — continued to frustrate me and I often isolated myself further with fantasies in the solace of my room. As a teen, I was confused navigating my social life. Budding friendships blossomed one day, then crashed the next day as I was picked on by my peers. The moodiness and disloyalty amongst peers impacted my feelings of isolation and of feeling different. At home in the solace of my room, I would replay these interactions and rewrite them to be accepted and valued instead of teased or rejected. The ongoing commentary, intrusive thoughts, and self-absorption I felt as I compared myself to my peers was painful.

### ID: p48-4
Then, one ordinary day, I took one of dad's beers and drank it really fast. For the first time, the thoughts stopped. The self-conscious nervousness eased. I continued to drink daily but found that I would black out, so I needed to be careful. I started to hang around with punks, goths, skaters, and metalheads. Like them, I was exploring who I was and what this world was, and experimenting with a plethora of substances. I dropped out of high school. I ran away from home. I was a fixture at the local mall and at nightclubs, which stayed open until 4 a.m. I recall more than one occasion "coming to" with people I had just met, walking in stocking feet in downtown San Jose or in San Francisco as the sun came up.

### ID: p48-5
As for my choice of substances, I didn't ask when you held out your hand with pills, powders, pipes or liquids. I took them all with a smile influenced by Jack Daniels.

### ID: p48-6
At seventeen, I "came to" five months pregnant. I had a few boyfriends within my circle of friends. My self-esteem was nil and the yearning to be accepted led to complicated romances, obscured boundaries, and much heartache. The attachment to being wanted and valued oscillated with thoughts of self-annihilation. But when I found out I was pregnant, I felt I had a reason to live. Flashes of budding flowers, the ocean, trees in the forest, sunbeams; all the beauty in the natural world came to me. I wanted to show my daughter all these things of wonder. Overnight, I stopped using substances for her. At the time, one could not attend school with a child, so I finished high school via independent studies a year later than my friends.

### ID: p48-7
After enrolling in junior college, I was reintroduced to meditation through yoga, a practice I recalled watching as a child on the show "Lilias Yoga and You" on our little black-and-white television. I was intrigued. I was gifted Thich Nhat Hanh's book, The Miracle of Mindfulness and integrated these practices in my daily life. When I was washing dishes, I practiced knowing I was washing dishes. When I was changing the baby's diaper, I practiced knowing I was changing the baby's diaper. Being with my breath during times of stress and times of ease. Being present. I felt as though there was space for everything and there were more instances of ease when "I" was out of the way. The interesting thing is that when I started to read and practice more of the Dharma, it felt like I already knew these practices. It felt like coming home.

### ID: p48-8
I stayed abstinent for a couple years until college. People say you pick up where you left off and that it gets worse. That was my experience. It became much worse. I entered into an abusive relationship, which landed me in the hospital due to physical abuse and neglecting my health. I stayed out of relationships for a bit, then landed in another one that was tumultuous, with more physical and emotional abuse and an abundance of methamphetamine.

### ID: p48-9
All of my "YETs" ("you're eligible too") were happening. All except that I was not incarcerated (my partner was) and I did not die, though I came close numerous times. I was 23 when my boss told me that if I wanted to keep my job, I needed to go to a 12-step meeting. I remember thinking, the audacity of my employer! It was a job at a local art film theater in which all of us worked and used drugs together. In hindsight, this was an intervention. My boss went with me to the meeting, and afterwards we went to the bar and had a beer. Neither of us knew that this was not what one does when trying to get sober from substances. I did not continue attending those meetings. I quit my job and my life spiraled out of control for six months, resulting in an overdose in April 1996. Regret, grief, sorrow, and hopelessness overcame me. I was on the floor when I came to and shortly after, I called my mother. For the first time — or maybe it was the first time that I listened — she told me with tears that she could no longer help me and that I may die from my addiction.

### ID: p48-10
With despair and what felt like having a faint pulse and being near death, I geared up. Literally. It took me eight hours to get ready to go to a noon 12-step meeting, the same one I'd been introduced to by my old boss. Except this time, I announced myself. This time, I listened. This time, I stayed. A couple of weeks in, I started outpatient counseling with an addiction specialist. I worked with him for almost 90 days, then acquired a sponsor, a mentor to work through the 12-steps. I chose this woman because her hair was three different colors, she practiced meditation, and part of her story was hijacking a plane to marry one of the Beatles. I thought, "This woman will not put up with my bullshit and has likely heard it all."

### ID: p48-11
During this time, a few friends and I started a weekly women's recovery group that included Vipassana meditation and mindfulness practices. That group lasted for many years, ebbing and flowing, but the practice was always the same: abstinence, meditation, sharing recovery challenges and strengths, talking about the solution and agreeing to guidelines of wise speech. I didn't know it at the time but it gave me a foundation that was familiar when I later joined Buddhist recovery communities.

### ID: p48-12
I married someone also in recovery and we did service work together, creating a robust and vibrant community. We had a son and bought a house. I continued to hold the women's groups. I've often heard that when we become abstinent and practice mindfulness in as many moments as we can, we will feel better. "Better" does not mean "happy." Better means to feel, with the opportunity to "know" all the sensations of that moment: happy, sad, worried, irritated, loss, joy — all of it!

### ID: p48-13
One lesson for me came in 2008, a difficult year because three people closest to me died, I lost my house, and my daughter went through a traumatic event. One of those who died was my husband, who was killed by someone driving under the influence of alcohol. I found myself parenting on my own again with an eighteen-year-old and a three-year-old. It was overwhelming that one day life is like this and the next, it is like that. And yet this is one of the greatest teachings, anicca, that nothing stays the same and everything changes. All is impermanent. That is not to say I did not grieve or ponder late into the night, questioning who I was. My meditation practice and the support of people in a recovery community who mentored me throughout the first decade of abstinence instilled a confidence or faith in myself. I was in pain, but I did not once think about using a substance to alleviate it. Cravings did not remove me from reality, but helped me to immerse myself in my breath, in the sensations, in the grief in order to understand it. I could only do this because I knew it too would pass because it too was impermanent.

### ID: p48-14
This way of relating to myself allowed me to show up in the world with perseverance, compassion, and courage — utilizing every experience as an opportunity to connect with myself and others and share in the depth of what it means to be human. I was asked to speak at recovery meetings about my experience. I spoke at DUI classes, telling my story to folks stuck in the cycle of alcoholism and driving while intoxicated. I wanted to both educate people about the effects of alcoholism as well as support myself in processing the loss.

### ID: p48-15
When my son was old enough for me to leave him with a sitter, I started attending meditation retreats. This allowed my nervous system to settle, for the internal chatter to settle, and to meet what bubbles up underneath, which is often what I distract myself from feeling. I soon moved closer to the ocean and took refuge in a local Buddhist meditation center, eventually becoming a community Dharma teacher at Insight Santa Cruz.

### ID: p48-16
My focus was on the heart practices (brahmaviharas), the intersection of the Eightfold Path and recovery, and the foundations of mindfulness. In 2013, a friend shared the manuscript of his upcoming book about Buddhist recovery. The components of this program were exactly what I was practicing. It was amazing to create a local, then global, community that integrated meditation and mindfulness practices with abstinence and wise action to be free of entanglements of the mind while building a life within community.

### ID: p48-17
For five years, I was very active in that community. I managed retreats, co-hosted conferences, and engaged in the daily work of fostering a refuge for suffering folks who were clinging to greed, hatred, and delusion in order to eradicate it. Being part of this eclectic sangha was thrilling. Here were the punks, goths, skaters, and metalheads, practicing while listening to great music, the music we grew up on. However, as with all things, there is always the Three Marks of Existence: dukkha (suffering), anicca (impermanence), and anatta (not-self). This Buddhist recovery community was heavily influenced by unhealthy masculinity and inequities among leaders. Great heartache ensued as people were harmed and a sangha was fractured.

### ID: p48-18
In 2019, another Buddhist recovery program and community was created. Recovery Dharma emphasizes trauma-informed approaches and an egalitarian leadership within a diverse community. I moved my effort and energy into this new community as it aligned with the practices of not harming others, taking only what is offered, respecting relationships, being truthful, and practicing abstinence (in short, the Five Precepts) in a way that invited transparency and collaboration among members of the sangha.

### ID: p48-19
It is beautiful that there are many approaches, many paths, all pointing to the same "destination" — to be free from the Three Poisons of greed, hatred, and delusion. To be free of that which entangles the mind and obscures the heart. To be free from suffering and the causes of suffering.

### ID: p48-20
Recovery is a process. It is not an event, but a journey. Along the way we will meet many people. Some will activate unpleasant feelings, but these are our greatest teachers! Some will evoke pleasant feelings where we become attached — these too are our teachers! This ongoing practice teaches us to lean in, be curious, make an effort to understand, and let go.

### ID: p48-21
I am no longer pushing away experiences with myself or others, and I'm not clinging to experiences. I am somewhere in the middle. I'm not attached but aware and engaged. It is a daily, moment-to-moment practice, walking the middle path. It is in this practice that I befriended my own heart and made space for yours. It is in the Dharma that I continue to uncover, discover, and recover my true nature. I will share what was told to me by many others I met along this path: don't take my word for it, see for yourself.

Content Warning: Childhood sex abuse

### ID: p49-1
"There are basically two types of sex addicts. The first type is an internet user in recovery. The second type is an internet user." –Anonymous

### ID: p49-2
"Sex addict" carries baggage that wasn't all true for me. I didn't even realize, "I'm a sex addict," because my addiction seldom involved having sex. My acting out had more to do with pixels on screens and lusting for the height of self-pleasure. I use the term "lust" because it also includes my zombie mind-state — my insatiable hungry ghost.

### ID: p49-3
My primary addiction is lust. By age five, I was subjected to childhood sexual abuse (CSA). I was told it was a game. At the peak of it, it was the best feeling in the world. Since I enjoyed this game, I never suspected this was trauma or abuse — especially not "compared" to others'. But as Dr. Gabor Maté put it, "Trauma is not what happens to you. It's what happens inside you as a result of what happened to you." Inside, I lived a life of shame and secrecy.

### ID: p49-4
I'm pretty sure my hungry ghost was born the moment I realized I could play this game solo and indulge in self-pleasure anytime. By age six, I was hopelessly addicted. Not to sex, but to the neurochemical hit released by self-pleasure.

### ID: p49-5
My parents would catch me in the act. They were shocked, they would shout, and they would shame me, hoping that it would help me break this habit. They did the best they could with the knowledge they had. But scolding and shaming never helped. It just made it harder to get the help I needed.

### ID: p49-6
What I desperately needed was one safe person. Someone non-judgmental, present, and compassionate. I needed someone to ask me, "What happened?"

### ID: p49-7
Instead, I was saddled with a deep-seated sense of shame as my core identity. Despite how painful my shame was, I could not stop. To protect myself from the pain of shame, I developed a patchwork of unwholesome habits.

### ID: p49-8
To cover up the humiliating behaviors that I felt powerless to change, I learned to lie. It was less painful to tell a lie than to get caught masturbating.

### ID: p49-9
My addiction also compelled me to keep safe by hiding, isolating, and becoming hypervigilant. In fact — I recall the feeling of excitement when adults were going to leave me home alone. I knew that I was soon going to disconnect from the world and act out again. And while acting out, I cultivated lifelong hypervigilance and a fear of environmental disruptions, which paved a road to generalized anxiety disorder.

### ID: p49-10
As a child with an overwhelmed libido, many things that were probably normal to other kids would drive me insane, like seeing people in bathing suits. Walking through the underwear section of a department store. Or seeing models in advertisements. But the worst was just going to school every day. I would always feel attracted to, and in love with, someone in my class — sure it sounds like innocent love in this story, but to live that experience was to be flooded with shameful feelings that I didn't understand.

### ID: p49-11
These were extremely difficult events for me. The feelings were overpowering, agonizing, and confusing. I had no elder nor mentor to guide me through the darkness.

### ID: p49-12
If I pause for a moment and look back at what happened, I see why a child would naturally develop the traits I had. These were survival skills. They served to protect me from immense pain rooted in childhood complex trauma. It's clear to see how these traits predispose anyone to addiction when we list out the traits: dishonesty, secrecy, dissociation, disconnection, isolation, hypervigilance, shame.

### ID: p49-13
In youth, I blamed myself for being unable to control my habits. However, it's clearly unfair to blame the five year old sex addict. So I've always wondered — at what point is it justified to blame the addict for being addicted? Can we blame the ten or fifteen year old for the inability to quit?

### ID: p49-14
It was only in recovery from sex addiction, after completing an inventory, that I recounted and reconciled the wreckage in my rear-view mirror. Doing the inner work of self-inquiry and investigation revealed that lust influenced nearly every decision I made. Here's a tiny fraction of harms that I've tried to restore balance with: I objectified people — I was othering and dehumanizing. When dating, I would use alcohol/drugs/power to coax someone into staying the night. At other times, I would just prefer self-pleasure over actual sex, regardless of how sexually appealing my partner was. In most sexual relations, I found it challenging to reach climax unless I fantasized about porn — even if I hadn't viewed porn for months. When I used porn, I noticed that my tastes progressively became edgier and more shocking in order to achieve arousal.

### ID: p49-15
Just like my drug addiction, I crossed sexual lines I swore I'd never cross. I never thought I would arrange meetups for anonymous sex or compensated companionship. I knew I needed to hit the brakes long ago, but seeking sexual gratification was my life purpose. Without the hungry ghost, could I enjoy life? Who was I before the world got to me?

### ID: p49-16
For about ten years, I drifted in and out of recovery rooms for substance use disorder. Then I turned thirty-nine in the hospital with pancreatitis, from alcohol abuse. Pancreatitis hurts like hell. It felt like I was getting tattooed inside my stomach for ten days straight with zero breaks. But it was less painful than the unassisted withdrawal from a prior fentanyl addiction that ravaged me. I considered pancreatitis a blessing from the universe and a final call to awakening. I said to myself, "This is where it has to stop. When I turn forty, there's no way in samsara that I can still be running on the same toxic rat wheel of addiction."

### ID: p49-17
That year, I began stopping. I slowly let go of who I thought I was. I stopped letting others define happiness and success for me. I stopped blaming others. I stopped denying reality. In the calmness, I could see how my addictive habits were all interconnected: alcohol, drugs, sex, codependency, technology, all of it. Incidentally, it was the same year that Recovery Dharma was established, so I could work on all addictions at the same time by using Buddhist practices to address the root cause of suffering.

### ID: p49-18
For the first time after some ten years of being in recovery, I finally took my recovery program seriously. I asked myself, "How much time was I willing to put into my addictive behaviors? And how much time am I willing to put into my recovery?" An honest, gentle voice from deep within suggested wisely, "Chase your recovery like you chased your addictions."

### ID: p49-19
So when they told me to get into service, I signed up and showed up. When they said to sit daily, I sat daily. When they said to go to meetings as often as possible, it made sense to go to the same number of meetings daily as the number of times I used to act out each day. And when they stressed the importance of sangha and inquiries, I did my best to create real connections within my sanghas and inquiry circles.

### ID: p49-20
Each ingredient of the practice made an important difference. I used to only share when I thought it would get people to approve of me. Then, one day at an in-person meeting, I decided to close my eyes, relax, and just listen. I stopped thinking about what I was going to share. Instead of hearing ways my story was different from the person sharing, I listened for all the ways that we shared common roots. Instead of grasping for external approval, I could finally hear how authenticity and weakness were the truer currency in rooms of recovery.

### ID: p49-21
I made a hard but wise choice, regarding renunciation from love and lust. I decided that, based on my past, I was unsafe to myself if I pursued recovery friendships with those whom I felt attracted to. Some of y'all might be able to handle that, but for this love and lust addict, I might as well be playing Russian roulette with my recovery. It was easier to fully renounce attractive recovery friends for the time, than to eventually have both my recovery and my heart shattered. I learned to love the new life of having true intimacy with friends without attachments of lust. It was a beautiful new road to nurture healthy relationships.

### ID: p49-22
Additionally, since I had experiential success in medication assisted treatment (MAT) for tapering off of opiates and nicotine, I asked health professionals about MAT for calming hypersensitivity to sexual triggers. "If this aphrodisiac exists, then that anti-aphrodisiac exists," I imagined the Buddha fantastically telling Ananda. Eventually, I was recommended herbal supplements. I don't know if they really worked or if it was just the placebo effect, but I didn't care — within a couple months, I had a breakthrough.

### ID: p49-23
I went on a vacation where there was the ocean, beaches, and lots of human beings in bathing suits. Since childhood, this environment was a trigger where I would obsess uncontrollably about the beautiful people passing by. But on that vacation, I was different. People were still beautiful, but I observed myself and became fully present to an unfamiliar "quiet." I could hear myself think! I didn't have to be hyper focused on where each beautiful person was — I found I had a choice over what I concentrated on. I didn't have to obey the hungry ghost. This newfound glimpse of control over my libido astounded me. I had never experienced this level of equanimity and serenity. I was forty years old. That was a very emotional day for me.

### ID: p49-24
Recovery Dharma gave me a way to own my entire story that was drastically different from what I experienced in traditional 12-step spaces. I used to be asked to avoid discussing "unrelated" addictions such as alcohol, drugs, or sex, depending on what kind of meeting I was attending. In RD, I could talk about all the issues of my recovery without being censored. This allowed me to share how critical it is to connect the dots between (1) my process addiction; (2) my substance addiction; and (3) my complex trauma from childhood. In the Dharma, there's no such thing as an "outside issue" to my recovery when all things are interdependent.

### ID: p49-25
Something tells me that Recovery Dharma will withstand the test of time. Not only because it's founded on a healing program that's been helping people for thousands of years, but also because Recovery Dharma is future-proofed: our fellowship doesn't have to spawn a new fellowship for each new process addiction that arises. Among the most powerful aspects of RD is that we are empowered to easily create a new affinity group (special-interest or topic meeting), so we can find others who face, or have overcome, similar struggles. For example, when some of us noticed there wasn't a meeting for people suffering from love and lust, we created a sangha and meetings for it. And you can do the same with your own affinity group. Even though all addictions are welcome at all meetings, I've experienced a deepened connection, wisdom, and healing with others concentrating on the same topic.

### ID: p49-26
I used to make unthinking comments about other process addictions, especially if I didn't relate to the addiction. Eventually, I could see how I was shaming, minimizing, and gossiping about another person's recovery journey. I was unskillfully hindering their healing. I was doing exactly what others had done when shame, stigma, and embarrassment kept me in my spiral of silence for thirty-five years. I've retrained myself to notice before I judge, criticize, or invalidate anyone's struggle. Instead, I reflect on the courage it takes for someone to open up about their inner battlefield. I believe as long as we can honor one another's struggles, this fellowship will thrive.

### ID: p49-27
When I think about the baggage that comes with "sex addict," sometimes my trauma sends me backward and wondering, "Is it really okay to share about sex addiction here in Recovery Dharma?" And then I'm reminded that sex addiction is the very first process addiction that our book specifies — and it's mentioned repeatedly. The authors knew what they were doing. Heck, the Buddha devoted a whole precept to suffering less from our sexual conduct. So if sex addiction is causing you suffering, but you're waiting for permission to share and heal about it, our program and our book have already given us permission.

### ID: p49-28
So, once more with love: it's okay to talk about sex addiction in Recovery Dharma.
## Chapter 50: Randall

### ID: p50-1
I was the "golden child." The one who could seemingly do no wrong. Or at least that was the image that I tried to cultivate. Because when I was less than the best, the consequences at home could be severe. So I stopped asking for help, and I started hiding the parts of me that were deemed weak. I put on a mask of perfection, and the weight of it would almost kill me.

### ID: p50-2
When I was fifteen, I discovered how to use drugs to disconnect from my painful reality. For the next 20 plus years, I would become a mad scientist of sorts seeking to numb my suffering through substances. Feelings were deemed unhelpful and had to go. Productivity was prioritized as I had come to believe that my worth was determined only by how much I could accomplish.

### ID: p50-3
I had to be "golden." So I became an exceptionally high achiever. But I was also just exceptionally high all of the time.

### ID: p50-4
Alcohol was first. It was like a magic elixir that made being around people less scary. Marijuana was next. It could numb the pain of never feeling good enough. Finally, after I became a lawyer, I met my beloved amphetamines. They were the rocket fuel that could propel me to work insane hours, so I could acquire all of the things that would finally make me feel like I was worthy.

### ID: p50-5
The problem was — even after I became the big success that I was groomed to be and procured all of the material things that I had been taught would make me whole — I felt utterly wretched and spiritually empty. I told no one what was going on. I stayed hidden because I thought they would reject me if they knew the "real" me. And, of course, I didn't want them to make me stop.

### ID: p50-6
Instead of looking inward, I blamed all the external things in my life. I tried changing jobs, but I still lacked purpose. And I was still a drug addict. Wherever I went, there I was.

### ID: p50-7
In April 2017, I was coaching my daughter's youth soccer game, and my toes started tingling. "Better not tell anyone," I thought, "they might realize I have a drug problem." But 72 hours later, I had a much bigger problem. The tingling spread to my entire body, and I became paralyzed from head to toe due to a rare auto-immune disease called Guillain-Barre Syndrome.

### ID: p50-8
I was locked in my body and in a state of total isolation for about 40 days. I was on a ventilator and feeding tube and unable to communicate with anyone. I was completely aware of what was happening but cut off from the rest of the world. I started experiencing psychosis, and the traumas of my past and my fears for the future manifested as hallucinations and delusions.

### ID: p50-9
I was also going through withdrawals. I was in the realm of the hungry ghosts. I spent most days sincerely wishing I would die.

### ID: p50-10
Those forty days changed my life. I experienced unimaginable physical, psychological, and emotional pain. It then took several months for me to be able to walk, talk, and take care of myself again. I promised myself that I would make the most of my second chance. And, if my life had been a Hollywood movie, I would have learned my lesson. I would have quit for good.

### ID: p50-11
But that is not the way it works.

### ID: p50-12
Nothing outside of me was going to save me from what was happening internally. Deep within me, there was a demon of sorts, and it manifested as an impulsive and compulsive desire to avoid suffering via self-medicating. I started using again. My wife threatened to leave me and take our three beautiful ginger-haired girls if I did not get help. So, I finally went to treatment.

At the rehab, they would load us on the druggie buggy and haul us off to a 12-step meeting every night. I learned a few helpful things, but the program did not resonate with me. I saw a lot of people who were clean. But, they appeared to still be suffering greatly. I did not want to just stay sober. I wanted to cultivate a life I did not want to escape from. I didn't want to feel powerless. I wanted to be empowered.

One day, my counselor asked me if I wanted to meet with a Buddhist chaplain. "I don't know anything about Buddhism," I thought, "but I'm bored, so why not?" A friendly bald and bearded man appeared at the unit a few hours later. That afternoon, I told him my life story and he introduced me to Buddhism, focusing mostly on the First Noble Truth: "In life, there is suffering." "No shit," I thought to myself as I stared out the fifth floor window of the psych hospital.

### ID: p50-15
The Buddhist "religion" he described did not really seem like a religion at all to me. It seemed more like an ethical framework for living. He told me that there were recovery meetings that used Buddhist-inspired principles and practices. A few nights later, we were allowed to go to one. I walked in the room that night and people were smiling. They seemed to be at ease. The meditation started. I had only meditated once before in my life, and it had not gone well. I was a speed freak after all. But something different happened this time. By the end of the sit, I felt this lightness in my chest. I could not figure out what it was at first, but I just allowed myself to be curious about it until I finally identified it. It was self-compassion. And it felt amazing.

### ID: p50-16
Like I was finally coming home and resting after an arduous journey.

### ID: p50-17
Upon leaving rehab, I immersed myself in the program. Soon, I was one of the regulars. I noticed that the people who served the most seemed to be the most at ease, so I started serving too. When COVID came, I started facilitating multiple meetings a week to stay connected. I began to realize that nothing could help me more than helping other people. So I just kept showing up and serving in positions with more and more responsibility. Eventually, I was elected President of the Board of the global nonprofit and found purpose in protecting and promoting the program. I also kept helping my local sangha grow, and I still go to multiple meetings a week. Because that is where my wise friends are. That is where we heal together.

### ID: p50-18
The reality of my recovery was not a fairy tale where I lived "happily ever after." When my addiction shifted to processes such as bulimia and overexercising, I leaned into my program to establish wise boundaries and stop harming myself. Slowly, I started to make wiser choices and live with more balance. My goal was not to be "golden" or even "happy" anymore. It was just to be present, live with purpose, and suffer less.

### ID: p50-19
Recovery Dharma helped me tap into my Buddha nature. It armed me with an understanding of karma and taught me to plant seeds of self-compassion instead of self-destruction. Through meditation, I increased my ability to sit with emotional distress and cultivate positive mental states. Through inquiry work, I investigated the causes of my suffering and explored solutions.

### ID: p50-20
I used to wake up in despair and need substances to get out of bed and face reality. Now, I wake up early and meditate. I set intentions to follow the precepts and trust the process. I try to practice radical acceptance of myself, others, and reality. When I crave things to be different, I remember the truth of impermanence. When I'm in trouble, I ask for help from my wise friends.

### ID: p50-21
Thanks to Recovery Dharma, I am also a more empathetic partner and gentle father. My family no longer has to be the collateral damage of my implosive cycle. I practice wise speech with my wife and no longer hide my wounded parts. I teach my daughters about meditation and mindfulness, and I can already see how they are coping with stress at school in healthier ways.

### ID: p50-22
I am not "better" though. Just better at being broken. My demons still appear to me on a daily basis. But, when they do, I greet them with a smile and invite them to tea. I sit with them and ask them "what's really going on?" And usually they answer "I don't want to feel this way." So I put my arm around them. And then I have the feelings because - if I don't - they will have me.

### ID: p50-23
I don't have to do anything to "fix" them. I can just let them be. I also recognize that I am going to frequently fail. That's what humans do. So when I fall short, I try to be easy and gentle with myself. Because I am worthy of love and compassion. This is the truth Recovery Dharma has taught me. And the beautiful thing is, you don't even have to believe that it's true. You just have to believe you have the potential to change and heal your life.

### ID: p50-24
And you will.

### ID: p50-25
Above all else, I try to stay present. At meetings, I listen attentively and stay with others through their pain. At home, I read books with my daughters and marinate in the sensation of joy. In these moments of pure presence, I sometimes remind myself that I didn't have to do anything to deserve this. Despite all of the addiction and trauma I have endured, I've been golden all along.
## Chapter 51: Lacey

The week I'm writing this, I celebrated seven years of being on this path and Recovery Dharma has been with me for practically the entire time. My sobriety has been built on the wisdom of the Dharma and the empowerment to decide what my recovery should look like.

### ID: p51-2
I was clinging onto about six months of sobriety when I started going to our Buddhist recovery meetings in New York City. At the time, there were only two meetings in the city and one of them happened to be within walking distance of my apartment in Brooklyn. When I came in, I saw a friendly, low-key, queer space and while I was nervous, I also felt safe. The folks I saw there that first evening would eventually invite me to vegan tacos around the corner and one would become my mentor. I wanted to be like these people and spend time with them.

### ID: p51-3
It always felt like I was ancestrally predestined to be an "alcoholic" and to experience the heavy shame that is its close companion. From an early age I was taught about how one becomes an alcoholic and what an alcoholic looks and behaves like. I also learned that it was an identity you didn't share with others, that you had to keep it a secret. My family tradition of silence had been passed down from likely hundreds of years of addiction inspired by the trauma of shame, poverty, and violence.

### ID: p51-4
Active addiction felt like being buried under layers of heavy blankets. I couldn't move, couldn't really breathe, but was also somewhat comfortable laying there, being flattened. It was a way to make myself smaller and quiet my instincts. I think of that Marianne Williamson quote a lot about how we actually fear our brightness and ability more than we fear our darkness and inadequacy.

### ID: p51-5
I don't remember a ton of details from my twelve years of active addiction. I do know that it was fun in the beginning. I worked in media, and drinking was part of the job description. I was good at drinking a lot and it was good for my career. My lifestyle was buying party dresses I couldn't afford, going to boozy events with bold-faced names, staying out until 4 am and sharing hangovers in the office with the coworkers I had partied with. I did a lot of convincing people to drink with me when they didn't really want to and racking up debt trying to keep up with the hungry ghost inside of me. I also put myself in plenty of dangerous situations but like I said, much of it is pretty blurry. I kept going at full speed, abusing my mind and body, knowing that if I slowed down even slightly I may not be able to get going again.

### ID: p51-6
This kind of lifestyle was the one I thought I was supposed to have and what everyone wants to have (besides the debt, danger, and daily hangovers). I was purposefully ignoring and shoving down my need for quiet alone time, reflection, and spirituality. Through therapy and late-in-life diagnoses, I know now that my neurodiverse brain is easily overstimulated by noise, crowds, and visuals and when that happens, I can become nonverbal. I plowed through all of this with the help of alcohol.

### ID: p51-7
Ultimately this all led to my becoming very isolated with terrible depression and anxiety. I couldn't respond to emails or, God forbid, answer phone calls. I could barely finish my sentences when I spoke. I would trail off and go quiet hoping the other person would pick up the end of the thought for me. I didn't have confidence in anything that came out of my head. I would wake up every morning absolutely hating myself, calling myself dumb and ugly and pathetic. I would review, or try to remember, every stupid thing I had said or done the night before and then reel from the shame. That shame took up a leaden residence in my body.

### ID: p51-8
These intense feelings of low self-worth inspired me to seek relationships with the wrong people. I thought I had to drink in order to find connection but drinking only led me to unhealthy connections that ended up lasting years.

### ID: p51-9
Even though I was surrounded by sober people in my family, I found the idea of quitting drinking to be unimaginable. It felt like, if I could do that, I could achieve anything I wanted in life (I still think this is true). Besides the physical and psychological dependence, I'd have to take on the identity of the addict or alcoholic. Someone who had to keep this large shameful part of themselves a secret, who could no longer have fun or be "normal". A life of sobriety was a life sentence and a burden.

### ID: p51-10
I made the first steps to getting sober once the alarm bells from my childhood education about alcoholism got too loud for me to ignore. I was drinking earlier and earlier in the day and my depression and anxiety were becoming unmanageable. My entire life had been taken over by the when, where, how, and what to drink. I was scared that I had to hit my proverbial "rock bottom" before I quit but that turned out not to be true.

### ID: p51-11
There were a number of aspects I knew about traditional recovery that I was wary of. I am used to doing things on my own and taking care of myself, so that's how I was going to do recovery too. No "fellowship" for me! I was lucky enough to find an addiction counselor I connected with right off the bat and she was the one who eventually suggested I check out Buddhist recovery so I could at least have some examples of how sober lives were lived. Or at least the kind of sober life I wanted to live.

### ID: p51-12
When I first started going to meetings, I had never meditated before so I would sit there and kind of peek out and see what people were doing — are they really "meditating"? I didn't get it. Eventually, though, I figured I might as well give it a shot. One of my late-in-life diagnoses was obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and when I started out I thought that if I didn't meditate perfectly it wouldn't count. Luckily, that's not true at all — there's practically no wrong way to meditate. Eventually, meditation started doing its magic on me. I found that if I had a craving I could see it and not get swept up in its pull. The craving would be like a hot air balloon floating all by itself in my head and my natural reaction would be to be curious and kind about it. "Ah, I wonder why that appeared." Through an ongoing meditation practice, I now see other cravings, like for sugar and online shopping, pop up as well. I can investigate why it's coming up: Am I bored? Am I avoiding a difficult emotion?

### ID: p51-13
The concept of "fellowship" or being part of a community of sober people, felt pretty lame to me when I first considered entering recovery. I don't think I'm the only addict that doesn't want to be a burden or rely on or trust other people to be there for me (in fact I know that's not the case because we've dedicated a whole section to it in this book, Isolation and Connection, pg 43). Making these friendships in the beginning had real middle school lunchroom vibes — except in this case everyone invites you to sit with them.

### ID: p51-14
Before the pandemic, our sangha in New York City would get dinner together in Koreatown every Saturday night after our meeting. Over bowls of vegetarian bibimbap we would discuss our sober dating misadventures, ongoing family dramas, and the basics of how to get through life without numbing yourself. Having someone running along-side you can make you want to keep going and forming these friendships has been one of the greatest gifts of my recovery.

### ID: p51-15
This same sangha persuaded me to enter local service leadership positions and because it felt like such a welcoming space with people truly being their different selves, I felt comfortable enough to join with my unsure voice. The more experience I had in service positions, the more confident my voice grew to the extent that I now engage in full-on debates in our RDG board meetings. As the book says, to engage in wise speech is to use our voice, especially if we've felt like "we don't have permission to use our voices or lack the power to speak and be heard" (pg 28).

### ID: p51-16
Sharing my opinions and thoughts out loud can be nerve-wracking and uncomfortable. Many times afterward I would repeatedly go over — and over — the things I said, reviewing them for their articulateness and impact. But I have discovered through this path that the key to freedom is learning to sit through discomfort. And my mindfulness practice helps me do that — identifying where I feel it in my body and letting it be. Granted, it will be a lifelong practice.

### ID: p51-17
My recovery journey, especially the service I have taken part in at my local sangha and the global nonprofit, has done a lot to heal some of that generational trauma I spoke of earlier. I'm healing myself with methods that are the opposite of what has been traditional in my family. I do my best to be kind and compassionate to myself and take time for self-care and healing. And I enjoy sharing my sober identity and speaking about my experience with addiction very openly. The Dharma has taught me that there is no shame in suffering because it is universal. Addiction is simply a symptom of that suffering.

### ID: p51-18
Recovery Dharma's commitment to empowerment has been the foundation of my recovery. To begin to recover, it turned out that I needed to learn to put my needs first, to build confidence in myself and my ability to sit through cravings, anxiety, and other extreme discomfort. I have been able to do all of that, slowly but surely, through this path. RD has taught me I can trust myself and my instincts and that if I listen, I will heal. The voice of the Buddha nature in me is becoming easier to hear. It's soft but sure and it leads me into doing what another fellowship describes as the "next right thing". You have the same voice inside of you too.
## Chapter 52: Paul

### ID: p52-1
I bought a pack of cigarettes as soon as I could after I quit drinking. I told myself I deserved something if I wasn't going to have my nightly bottles of white wine and glasses of Jameson, and everybody knows that folks in recovery are some of the heaviest smokers out there. So I started with Camel regulars, and ended up with American Spirit unfiltered. I went from cups of coffee to extra-large buckets of Dunkin' Donuts caramel-swirl-extra-cream-extra-sugar, and from an online flirtation into an affair that almost brought my marriage to an end. I just always kept reaching for something else.

### ID: p52-2
I like to say I was lucky because I started out with a lot of friends who were already in recovery. Noah Levine's book Dharma Punx welcomed a lot of misfits like me to Buddhism: a way of approaching this ancient path that didn't seem as bougie and hippie-dippy as I thought so much of American Buddhism was. A bunch of folks from the old Boston hardcore scene — sober and otherwise — started up a Dharma Punx meeting in a recovery center right on Paul Revere's route in Arlington, and I decided I may as well check that out. What I found was not just meditation, but community: people honestly sharing with the confidentiality and safety that, as I'd learn, is the heart and soul of so many recovery groups. That safe space became a Refuge that a lot of us had nowhere else in our lives. We built friendships in that room. I met my future wife in that room. And when I finally made a decision to quit, I had people I could call from that room.

### ID: p52-3
Okay, I was lucky. But maybe, just maybe, there was also some part of me that knew deep down that there was something I needed to hear in those meetings.

### ID: p52-4
Fast-forward a few years. In 2013, bombs went off at the finish line of the Boston Marathon, killing three people and wounding hundreds. As the cops frantically chased the bombers through the cities of Boston, Cambridge, Watertown and Somerville, folks were locked down and told to shelter in place. But in Somerville, where I was living, liquor stores were still open. (because this is Mass we're talking about here). I spent that week day-drinking, with my wife out of town and unable to come home. That was the beginning of the end for me; I probably didn't have another sober day in the next six months. The blackouts got longer. I started hiding nips of liquor everywhere. I listened to my sober friends at Dharma Punx share about their drinking and using, and I began to see myself in those stories. To be honest, I think I quit partly because I wanted to be like my tough and courageous friends…even though my life, as they say, had become unmanageable, I didn't really feel like it. Yet.

### ID: p52-5
I started going to 12-step meetings, which are everywhere in hard-drinking Boston. I'd picked up a lot of horror stories from my Punx friends, though, about the narrow-mindedness and religiosity in the rooms, and so I was looking for something to be wrong even if it wasn't. Buddhist recovery wasn't really a 'thing' yet: Noah and his crew were still working on what would become Refuge Recovery, and books like Vimalasara's Eight Step Recovery and Kevin Griffin's One Breath at a Time were out there but local meetings hadn't been organized. So 12-step was, pretty much, the only game in town. There were a couple meetings I went to for a while, but I didn't do anything else. I didn't work a program, didn't get a sponsor. I was skeptical — like a lot of people, for good reason — of sponsorship and the Steps, but I just used that critique as a reason to "white-knuckle" my sobriety.

### ID: p52-6
The phenomenon of cross-addiction — of replacing one addiction with another — wasn't talked about much in the rooms of 12-step… or I sure as hell didn't hear it if it was. What I heard was "just don't drink," and I didn't. But I was up to a pack a day, I gained fifty pounds off of Dunks and salted caramel ice cream, and I was flirting compulsively online and in the real world. We'd moved to Vermont the year after I quit, and I found small-town meetings even more grumpy and Jesus-y than my old Cambridge home group. I was in free-fall. I started to think that it wouldn't be a big deal to just taste some of those famous Vermont microbrews and small-batch liquors. And my flirtations became long, graphic, intense conversations that took up hours of my days.

### ID: p52-7
You can probably see where this is going. Eventually, my wife found out.

### ID: p52-8
I got a sponsor and dragged myself back to 12-step, and it helped. It did. I worked the Steps, and I got a shrink and a prescription for Prozac because I felt like home-cooked crap 24 hours a day. My Fourth Step was a long, detailed narrative of all the people I'd screwed over with my drinking, using, and womanizing, and what a waste of skin I'd been for as long as I could remember. My wife hadn't left — yet — but it was still a day-to-day thing. I switched from cigarettes to caramel-flavored nicotine vape, but I was constantly restless, unsettled, and filled with self-rage. And then, I got lucky. Again.

### ID: p52-9
One day, I was meditating on my back porch using the Insight Timer app and I got a friend request. My new friend gave me some suggestions for guided meditations and told me about a Refuge Recovery meeting they were starting up in our little town. So, almost on a whim, I showed up. I read the book and came back most every week, and that's when things started to shift. I finally had a group of people I could be real with, like the Punx back in Boston. And I started to see how Buddhism and recovery fit together.

### ID: p52-10
But this path brought me face to face, again and again, with what in the Recovery Dharma book we call the "heart practices:" appreciative joy, compassion, lovingkindness, and equanimity. Getting into my heart — getting comfortable with my heart — has been the absolute key to my recovery and, especially at the start, was one of the hardest things I've ever tried to do. I can't even remember how many times I completely shut down right at the start of mettā (lovingkindness) meditation. Why? Because usually the way it begins is that you're supposed to send mettā to yourself. And I would just nope right the hell out of that. To the cynic in me, it just seemed like hippie-dippy nonsense. Deeper down, though? I just could not connect to the feeling of wanting myself to be well. I had this unconscious message in me that I had to be tough on myself if I was going to get anywhere in my recovery. What I didn't realize yet is that it was just the opposite: staying hard and closed was keeping me stuck.

### ID: p52-11
An opening came when a wise friend shared a recorded meditation — I think maybe it was led by Tara Brach, but I'm not sure — that started by sending mettā to a loved one rather than yourself. I didn't have a hard time with that, so I was able to stay with it. The focus of the meditation then moved on to a neutral person, to a difficult person, and to the whole world, and only then asked me to send mettā to myself. This was the break that I needed: the realization that if I could send well-wishes to the worst people in the world — dictators, murderers, people who spoil the ends of movies — I could also send them to me.

### ID: p52-12
This let me make some space in my mind and heart so I could stay present rather than shutting down into judgment, self-hatred, and fear. I stopped needing to numb that suffering with something, anything: nicotine, sugar, social media, whatever. I started to be able to look honestly at my past without getting stuck in a story about what a piece of shit I was, and began to recover.

### ID: p52-13
It made a huge difference to me that in Buddhist recovery we don't talk about it like recovery from illness. Instead, I saw myself as 'recovering' a lost part of myself, what the book refers to as "the part of us that's not traumatized, that's not addicted, that's not ruled by fear or shame" the part, it says, "where wisdom comes from" (pg 2). I became kinder, more patient, and a better wise friend to others because I had started to care about the suffering I'd been causing myself for so long. And instead of giving myself a hard time for giving myself a hard time, I could soften into it. I could see how my suffering was like the suffering of others. And I could finally, authentically, let my heart open.

### ID: p52-14
And again, I do feel like I've been lucky. I'll never deny that. At the same time, I have gratitude for the part of me "where wisdom comes from:" the part that was looking for healing before I even knew that's what I needed. I've come to trust that part of me, and I've been fortunate to be in community with other people who have recovered what the book calls "the pure, radiant, courageous heart where we find our potential for awakening." We've grown together as wise friends and supported each other through hard times and good. I was able to be present enough to heal my marriage through years of patient work with a kick-ass counselor. We even decided to start a family: something I never thought I would be grown-up enough or emotionally stable enough to do. I went back to school, earned a master's degree, and started to teach writing at a local community college. And I've been able to be of service to other people in recovery: facilitating my home group, acting as a mentor, and bringing a Recovery Dharma meeting into an inpatient detox facility.

### ID: p52-15
So whenever anybody asks about it, I try to encourage them to lean in to that hippie-dippy nonsense. It might be easy, or it might be as hard as it's been for me.

### ID: p52-16
But I always say, and I always will, that it is absolutely, without a doubt, 100% worth it.
## Chapter 53: Eunsung

Content Warning: Suicide

### ID: p53-1
I was born in South Korea and grew up in a rural area near the demilitarized zone. Overall, I had a happy childhood, but I also had to endure several episodes of violence and trauma. It is only through the healing of recovery and living a spiritual life that I can look back with joy and have compassion for my family and the generations of people who had to experience the suffering of living in that impoverished and war-torn area.

### ID: p53-2
When I was in the third grade, my family immigrated to the mountains of Appalachia in North Carolina. I already felt different before coming to the United States, but when I arrived I really felt out of place. I experienced what it was like to be othered. Due to the racism prevalent in the area, I felt isolated and unsafe at school and around town.

### ID: p53-3
When I got drunk and high for the first time, none of the heaviness of what I was experiencing mattered anymore. The name-calling and stares from other kids faded away. I felt like I could breathe deeply for the first time. I was painfully shy, and alcohol and drugs gave me the power to connect with others. I never thought substances would take me to a dark place. The tragedy of addiction was that what I thought was a solution to my suffering would eventually create more suffering for myself and my loved ones.

### ID: p53-4
I first found meditation when I was in college and read a neat little book on Taoist Alchemy. I meditated for the first time visualizing a golden egg melting down my body. I still drank and got high, even while meditating. I can see now that I was using meditation as another escape. I wasn't at peace with my present reality. I always ran.

### ID: p53-5
The next few years were a blur. After I graduated college, I worked as a wilderness camp counselor. One day, I had an alcohol-induced "epiphany." I thought, if this is all there is to life, then screw it, I am going to kill myself. But I also thought that I would like to see New Mexico before I died. Instead of driving back to work, I started driving west to Mt. Taylor in New Mexico. I walked out into the woods thinking I would have some grand spiritual experience. I didn't find enlightenment, but I did decide to not give up on life that day.

### ID: p53-6
I didn't get into recovery then. It would take multiple suicide attempts, lots of punk shows, and more aimless wandering before I found my way to healing. I still meditated periodically and I found some peace in Buddhist communities. But I am not sure if my sitting against a wall doing zazen eventually led me to where I am now. I was lost, and it felt like I was always aimlessly pursuing a new relationship or going to a new place to quiet the discomfort I felt on the inside. I lost relationships and career opportunities due to drugs and alcohol. It was a bit of a blur, but during this period I made multiple attempts at taking my life and none of them were successful. I felt so empty. I was lost in dukkha.

### ID: p53-7
I was living with my father and helping out at his church. I thought maybe I could bring anarchist philosophy into Christianity and wake up the boys I taught in bible study. So I went to a prestigious grad school in North Carolina and tried to appear spiritual. I also got involved with the Buddhist community at the school, and I led the morning sits on a regular basis. I was studying theology, interning at churches, leading youth groups, preaching, and leading prayer groups. I felt fake as I lived a double life. I was studying how to be a spiritual leader to others while I was hung over and miserable in my own life. I was not able to practice what I preached. I thought that if people could see how I really felt on the inside and the life I led, they would all reject me. At this time, my physical health started to deteriorate quickly as well.

### ID: p53-8
I left graduate school with a degree and lived and worked at an interfaith community in Washington, D.C. where people with and without intellectual disabilities shared life together. I once again lived a double life. I spent days being with people in a community that taught me to embrace my vulnerability, but at night I would numb my feelings by drinking. In the beginning, I would go out to bars in my neighborhood with friends, but toward the end I preferred drinking alone in my basement. Once again, my addiction led me to self-harm and suicidal thoughts.

### ID: p53-9
It was at that dark moment that I finally admitted to someone that I might have a problem. I finally got into recovery in October 2011. It hasn't been a perfect journey, but I am grateful for each moment and each day. I got clean initially through 12-step programs, but meditation was vital to my recovery. I had to relearn to meditate when I got clean. Sometimes, staring at a lit candle to start my day was the only peace I had from the chaos of my thoughts.

### ID: p53-10
I moved to Virginia in 2014. At the time, I was married and expecting the birth of a daughter. I got connected to the recovery community in a new place and kept meditating and walking the path as best I could. I would sometimes meditate with my daughter sleeping on my chest, feeling her breath against mine. It truly is an amazing gift to be a parent in recovery.

### ID: p53-11
I like to tell people that I found my way to Buddhist recovery by accident. I asked a friend from a 12-step group to start an 11th-step meeting with me, and they declined but instead asked me if I wanted to start a Refuge Recovery meeting. I had never heard of a recovery program that utilized Buddhist principles. In June 2014, we held our first meeting. Ever since then, my sangha has been vital to my recovery. Especially when I went through a divorce, the meetings became a safe place for me to just sit in silence and fall apart.

### ID: p53-12
In 2019, I went to the Refuge Recovery annual conference in Chicago, and it felt like all hell had broken loose. I was in shock going to my first Buddhist recovery conference and walking into division. It turned out that was the pivotal moment Recovery Dharma was born. I remember reading a draft of the Recovery Dharma book on the L train on my way to the airport to head back home. It felt like my heart was connecting with each word. I could feel not just one individual voice speaking to me, but a group of people sharing their experience and practice. A few people from my local sangha attended the conference in Chicago with me, and we brought back our experience and shared why it was so vital that our sangha transition to Recovery Dharma. Shortly after that, all of the meetings in our area voted to switch from Refuge to RD.

### ID: p53-13
I thought all the turmoil and chaos would be over, but little did I know another storm was coming. My local sangha was based in a city full of Confederate monuments, and it would be the epicenter of protests in the aftermath of George Floyd's murder — in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic. The monuments fell, and I had my practice to guide me so I could skillfully listen to my conscience without causing more suffering to myself and others. Some of my sangha's members died from overdose or addiction-related health reasons. It was a strange time, and I am still processing all the grief and loss. I decided to start another Recovery Dharma group online, and I facilitated and participated in inquiry circles. I tried to help others and live by the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path.

### ID: p53-14
My life today is one of increased connection and hope. As a hospice chaplain and grief counselor, I use my practice to be present and help others pass through times of transition and loss. I try to touch my own pain and the suffering of others with compassion. I try to see the beauty all around me in the small moments. Whether I am surfing a wave, going for a walk with my daughter, or even just sitting in traffic I try to stay present. I focus on my breath and recognize that I can mindfully breathe through any change and I can help others to do the same.

In these ways, I continue to help myself and others through my practice. I practice when life gets hard, and I also practice when life gets good. Buddhism and RD have given me a strong foundation, so I am empowered to transform my own life in a skillful way. I have taken on a lot of responsibility in the RD community, and lately my work has been preparing others to be peer leaders and doing so with compassion. I have found new meaning and purpose in Buddhist recovery and a path that helps me be present to life.

I hope my story guides someone who is lost and searching for the three jewels: Buddha, Dharma and Sangha. And remember — you do not have to walk this path alone.

May you be happy. May you be at ease. May you be free from suffering.
