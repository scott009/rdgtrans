# Work Order: Add Work Order Delivery Protocol to Session Start Document
Work Order ID: WO-SSQS-v2-SessionStart-Update-002  
Title: Add Work Order Delivery Protocol to Session Start Document  
Date Issued: 2025-12-11  
Supervisor: Scott Tobias  
Priority: High  

## Summary
This Work Order updates the authoritative Session Start Document to include the **Work Order Delivery Protocol**, requiring Work Orders to be delivered as `.md` files placed in the workspace before execution. This ensures deterministic processing, audit integrity, and full compliance with SSQS v2 governance.

---

## 1. PURPOSE
To update `SessionStart.md` so that:
- Sonnet requires Work Orders to be delivered as `.md` files  
- Sonnet validates Work Order presence and structure before execution  
- Sonnet refuses Work Orders delivered as raw text  
- Work Orders are stored and mirrored for audit/rollback  
- Execution cannot begin until the Work Order file is present  

This aligns session initialization with the Supervisor governance model and is required for Point 3 production stability.

---

## 2. SCOPE & BOUNDARIES

### 2.1 Allowed Directories
```
dochome/
dochome/session_start/
supervisor_updates/
workorders/
```

### 2.2 Forbidden Directories
```
src/
dist/
assets/
```

### 2.3 File Types in Scope
```
.md
```

---

## 3. EXECUTION MODEL (Sonnet / Haiku)

### 3.1 Sonnet Responsibilities
Sonnet must:
- Parse and validate this Work Order  
- Insert or update the **Work Order Delivery Protocol** section in `SessionStart.md`  
- Ensure formatting and placement follow project documentation standards  
- Verify that the protocol language is precise and SSQS-compliant  
- Generate a deterministic execution plan  
- Delegate actual file modifications to Haiku  

Sonnet is authorized by this Work Order to modify `SessionStart.md`.

### 3.2 Haiku Responsibilities
Haiku must:
- Apply the deterministic patch generated by Sonnet  
- Create a mirror copy in:  
  ```
  supervisor_updates/WO-SSQS-v2-SessionStart-Update-002/
  ```  
- Ensure no modifications occur outside the specified file  
- Halt and report errors on unexpected conditions  

### 3.3 Execution Rule
**Sonnet generates the plan; Haiku performs the repo modification.**

---

## 4. TASK DESCRIPTION
Modify `dochome/session_start/SessionStart.md` by adding the following new section:

---

### 🔷 Work Order Delivery Protocol (Insert This Exact Text)

```
## Work Order Delivery Protocol

All Work Orders MUST be delivered as `.md` files placed into the project workspace
(e.g., via file upload or drag-in) before Claude Code begins execution.

### Requirements

1. Sonnet MUST NOT accept Work Orders delivered as plain text.
   Only Work Orders provided as `.md` files are valid for execution.

2. The Work Order file MUST be located in:
   wohome/WO-xxxx.md

3. If the Work Order file is not present, Sonnet MUST respond:
   "Work Order file missing. Please upload the Work Order `.md` file."

4. Sonnet MUST validate:
   - file presence
   - Work Order ID
   - SSQS v2 structural compliance
   - allowed/forbidden directories
   - deterministic task definitions  
   BEFORE Haiku is permitted to execute.

5. Upon execution, Haiku MUST:
   - apply modifications defined in the Work Order
   - create a mirror copy in:
     supervisor_updates/<WO-ID>/

6. Sonnet MUST NOT allow execution to begin until the Work Order file is
   successfully validated.
```

## 5. METADATA FOR EXECUTION

### 5.1 File Inventory
```
dochome/session_start/SessionStart.md

### 5.3 Versioning
Append or update:
```
Session Start Document Version: 2.1
SSQS Version: 2.0
```

---

## 6. PLAN OF EXECUTION (Generated by Sonnet)
