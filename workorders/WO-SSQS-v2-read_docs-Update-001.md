# Work Order: Update read_docs.sh for SSQS v2 Compliance
Work Order ID: WO-SSQS-v2-read_docs-Update-001
Title: Align read_docs.sh Initialization Script With SSQS v2 Governance
Date Issued: 2025-12-11
Supervisor: Scott Tobias
Priority: High

## Summary
This Work Order updates the initialization script `read_docs.sh` to ensure Sonnet is correctly initialized under the **SSQS v2 governance model**. The script must load system-governance documents in the correct order and enforce Work Order–driven execution behavior. This ensures all future Claude Code sessions begin with the proper rules, responsibilities, and Work Order structure already active in Sonnet's context.

---

## 1. PURPOSE
To modify `/home/scott/gitrepos/rdgtrans/scripts/read_docs.sh` so that:

1. **SessionStart.md** is loaded FIRST as the governing initialization document.  
2. **SSQS_v2_WorkOrder_Template.md** is loaded SECOND.  
3. **sharedContext.md** is loaded THIRD as authoritative project context.  
4. All other documents are loaded AFTER these three critical governance documents.  
5. The script clearly identifies SSQS v2 as the governing execution framework.  
6. The script includes version stamping for audit purposes.

/home/scott/gitrepos/rdgtrans/docs/
/home/scott/gitrepos/rdgtrans/docs/session_start/
/home/scott/gitrepos/rdgtrans/docs/SSQS/

```

### 2.2 Forbidden Directories
```

/translations/
```

### 2.3 File Types in Scope
```
.sh
.md
```

---

## 3. EXECUTION MODEL (Sonnet / Haiku)

### 3.1 Sonnet Responsibilities
Sonnet must:
- Interpret this Work Order.  
- Generate a deterministic plan for modifying `read_docs.sh`.  
- Validate file paths.  
- Ensure modifications maintain script integrity.  
- Delegate all repo-affecting edits to Haiku.  

Sonnet **is authorized** to update `read_docs.sh` via Haiku.

### 3.2 Haiku Responsibilities
Haiku must:
- Apply the deterministic edits proposed by Sonnet.  
- Create a mirror copy of the updated script in:  
  ```
  supervisor_updates/WO-SSQS-v2-read_docs-Update-001/
  ```
- Make **no changes** outside the target script.  
- Halt and report any unexpected state.  

### 3.3 Execution Rule
**Sonnet plans. Haiku executes.**

---

## 4. TASK DESCRIPTION
Modify `read_docs.sh` to implement the following changes:

### **4.1 Load Documents in Correct SSQS v2 Order**
Replace or prepend the document-loading sequence with this exact ordering:

1. **Session Start (governance layer)**
```
dochome/session_start/SessionStart.md
```

2. **SSQS v2 Work Order Template**
```
dochome/SSQS/SSQS_v2_WorkOrder_Template.md
```

3. **sharedContext.md (authoritative project context)**
```
dochome/sharedContext.md
```

4. **All remaining project documents**, in any sensible order:
```
ClaudeGuide.md
CopilotGuide.md
NETLIFY_SETUP.md
SupervisorSessionQuickStart_v2.md
Tasks.md
presentationJson.md
presentationLayer.md
projspec.md
tmaster_container_spec.md
```

### **4.2 Add Script Version Header**
Insert at top of file:
```
# read_docs.sh — SSQS v2 Compliant Initialization
# Script Version: 2.0
# SSQS Version: 2.0
# Last Updated by: WO-SSQS-v2-read_docs-Update-001
```

### **4.3 Add Commentary Identifying Governance Load Order**
Insert block:
```
# SSQS v2 Initialization Order:
# 1. SessionStart.md — governs Sonnet/Haiku behavior and Work Order protocol
# 2. SSQS_v2_WorkOrder_Template.md — defines Work Order structure
# 3. sharedContext.md — authoritative project context
# 4. Additional project documents
```

### **4.4 Ensure Script Output Reflects Updated Behavior**
The script must print:
```
"SSQS v2 Initialization Complete — Governance Layer Loaded"
```
after the three core documents are loaded.

---

## 5. METADATA FOR EXECUTION

### 5.1 File Inventory
```
/home/scott/gitrepos/rdgtrans/scripts/read_docs.sh
```

### 5.2 Insert Locations
- Header insertion at line 1.
- SSQS documentation load section immediately after header.
- Governance commentary before file-loading logic.
- Replace or update existing loading sequence as needed.

### 5.3 Versioning
Append:
```
# WO Applied: WO-SSQS-v2-read_docs-Update-001
```
at end of script.

---

## 6. PLAN OF EXECUTION (Generated by Sonnet)
*To be generated during execution by Claude Code.*

---

## 7. EXECUTION (Performed by Haiku)
*Haiku will perform deterministic changes based on Sonnet’s plan.*

---

## 8. ERROR HANDLING & ESCALATION

### 8.1 Haiku
- Halt on syntax errors or missing-file conditions.
- Report exact stderr output.
- Do not guess or auto-correct.

### 8.2 Sonnet
- Diagnose script issues.
- Request clarification when necessary.
- Regenerate safe plan and retry.

---

## 9. DELIVERABLES
- Updated `read_docs.sh`.
- Copy stored in:
  ```
  supervisor_updates/WO-SSQS-v2-read_docs-Update-001/
  ```
- Execution summary from Sonnet.

---

## 10. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- read_docs.sh loads documents in new SSQS v2 order.
- Script contains version header.
- Script prints governance initialization confirmation.
- No unauthorized modifications.
- Supervisor_updates mirror copy exists.
- Script executes without errors.

---

## 11. NOTES
This Work Order MUST be applied before entering **Point 3**, since Sonnet must begin each session already aware of SSQS governance.
