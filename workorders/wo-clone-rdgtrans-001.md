# WO-CLONE-RDGTRANS-001

## SSQS v2 — CLONE Work Order

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Draft (Not Locked)  
**Execution Agent:** Claude Code (creates clone), User (Cursor jam session)  
**Related Protocol:** CLONE_WorkOrder_Template.md v1.0  

---

## 0. WORK ORDER HEADER

**Work Order ID:** WO-CLONE-RDGTRANS-001  
**Title:** CLONE full rdgtrans repository into freeagent sandbox for Cursor exploration  
**Date Issued:** 2026-01-03  
**Supervisor:** ChatGPT  
**Priority:** High  
**Type:** CLONE  

**Summary:**  
Create a full, non-git, writable clone of the `rdgtrans` project tree under the `freeagent` WSL user for unrestricted Cursor-based jam sessions. The clone is non-canonical, isolated from production, and governed by explicit exclusions and guardrails. No production files or repositories may be modified as part of this operation.

---

## 1. PURPOSE

Provide a safe, high-freedom sandbox for exploratory system work using Cursor, without requiring up-front subproject modeling. This CLONE establishes a complete working copy of the `rdgtrans` tree under `/home/freeagent/projects/rdgtrans`, while preserving SSQS governance by deferring all canonical changes to a later MIGRATE Work Order.

---

## 2. CLONE INVENTORY

### 2.1 Files to Clone (READ-ONLY Reference)

(None - this clone allows full modification for exploration freedom)

### 2.2 Directories to Clone (READ-ONLY Reference)

(None - this clone allows full modification for exploration freedom)

### 2.3 Files/Directories to Clone (MODIFIABLE)

All contents of `/home/scott/gitrepos/rdgtrans/` except exclusions listed in Section 2.5.

| Source Path | Purpose in Clone | Clone Path |
|------------|-----------------|------------|
| `/home/scott/gitrepos/rdgtrans/` | Full project tree for unrestricted exploration and side projects | `/home/freeagent/projects/rdgtrans/` |

**Important:** All files in the clone are writable by `freeagent`. No files copied by this Work Order are canonical. The clone is a sandbox for experimentation.

### 2.4 New Directories to Create (MODIFIABLE)

(None - all directories come from source tree)

### 2.5 Excluded Directories (MANDATORY)

The following paths must **not** be copied into the clone:

**Standard Exclusions**
- `.git/`
- `workorders/`
- `archive/`
- `corrections/`
- `output*/`
- `__pycache__/`
- `*.pyc`

**Rationale:**  
These paths represent canonical governance, archival data, generated output, or runtime artifacts and must not appear in exploratory environments.

---

## 3. CLONE TARGET

### 3.1 Target Location

Primary target path:
```
/home/freeagent/projects/rdgtrans
```

Ownership:
- User: `freeagent`
- Group: `freeagent`
- Permissions: writable by `freeagent`

### 3.2 Storage Requirements

Estimated size: ~200–500 MB (estimate only)

Available space verified prior to execution: **Required**

### 3.3 Clone Lifespan

- Expected lifespan: **Disposable**
- May be deleted after experimentation or retained temporarily for reference
- No automatic archival required for this CLONE

---

## 4. GUARDRAILS

### 4.1 Forbidden Operations in Clone

❌ NEVER commit or initialize a git repository inside the clone  
❌ NEVER push clone contents to any remote  
❌ NEVER copy files from clone back into production paths manually  
❌ NEVER treat clone artifacts as canonical  
❌ NEVER write from Cursor to `/home/scott` paths  

### 4.2 Cursor Configuration

- Cursor **must** run as the `freeagent` user
- Cursor workspace root **must** be:
  ```
  /home/freeagent/projects/rdgtrans
  ```
- Cursor must not open files outside the clone directory

A `.cursorrules` file **may** be added inside the clone root to reinforce these constraints (optional but recommended).

### 4.3 Environment Verification

Before jam session begins, verify:

- Clone directory exists and is writable by `freeagent`
- `.git/` directory does **not** exist anywhere inside the clone
- Production paths are unreadable or read-only depending on `prodview` toggle
- Cursor cannot access production write paths

---

## 5. CLONE EXECUTION PLAN

### 5.1 Execution Agent

**Agent:** Claude Code  
**Environment:** VSCode / production WSL environment  
**Privileges:** sudo (required for ownership and verification only)

Claude Code executes this CLONE to ensure correct isolation and permissions.

### 5.2 Execution Steps (High-Level)

1. Verify `freeagent` user exists and is not currently in `prodview`
2. Create target directory:
   ```
   /home/freeagent/projects/rdgtrans
   ```
3. Copy source tree from:
   ```
   /home/scott/gitrepos/rdgtrans
   ```
   excluding all paths listed in Section 2.3
4. Ensure `.git/` is absent from clone
5. Set ownership of clone tree to `freeagent:freeagent`
6. (Optional) Create `.cursorrules` file
7. Verify isolation and permissions

Exact copy commands and flags (e.g., `rsync --exclude`) will be documented in Section 6 (execution plan generated by Sonnet).

## 6. PLAN OF EXECUTION (Generated by Sonnet)

**Generated by:** Sonnet (Claude Code)
**Date:** 2026-01-03
**Status:** Approved for Haiku execution

### Pre-Execution Analysis

**Current State:**
- freeagent user: Exists (uid=1001, gid=1002) ✓
- prodview membership: NOT in prodview (default isolation) ✓
- Source size: 292 MB
- Available disk space: 947 GB ✓
- Target directory: Does not exist ✓
- Parent directory (/home/freeagent/projects): Does not exist (will create)

**Clone Strategy:**
- Use rsync with exclusions for efficient, verified copy
- Preserve permissions and timestamps from source
- Set ownership to freeagent:freeagent after copy
- Create metadata files for guardrails and Cursor configuration

### Execution Steps

**STEP 1: Pre-Flight Checks**
```bash
# Verify freeagent exists
id freeagent || { echo "ERROR: freeagent user does not exist"; exit 1; }

# Verify NOT in prodview (default isolation)
groups freeagent | grep -q prodview && { echo "WARNING: freeagent is in prodview - has production read access"; } || echo "GOOD: freeagent isolated (not in prodview)"

# Verify target doesn't already exist
test -d /home/freeagent/projects/rdgtrans && { echo "ERROR: Target already exists"; exit 1; } || echo "GOOD: Target does not exist"

# Check disk space (need ~500MB to be safe)
available=$(df /home/freeagent | tail -1 | awk '{print $4}')
echo "Available disk space: ${available}KB"
```

**STEP 2: Create Target Directory**
```bash
# Create parent directory
sudo mkdir -p /home/freeagent/projects

# Set ownership of parent
sudo chown freeagent:freeagent /home/freeagent/projects

# Verify
ls -ld /home/freeagent/projects
```

**STEP 3: Copy Source Tree with Exclusions**
```bash
# Use rsync to copy with exclusions
sudo rsync -av \
  --exclude='.git/' \
  --exclude='workorders/' \
  --exclude='archive/' \
  --exclude='corrections/' \
  --exclude='output*/' \
  --exclude='__pycache__/' \
  --exclude='*.pyc' \
  /home/scott/gitrepos/rdgtrans/ \
  /home/freeagent/projects/rdgtrans/

# Verify copy completed
test -d /home/freeagent/projects/rdgtrans || { echo "ERROR: Copy failed"; exit 1; }
echo "Copy completed"
```

**STEP 4: Set Ownership**
```bash
# Change ownership of entire clone to freeagent
sudo chown -R freeagent:freeagent /home/freeagent/projects/rdgtrans

# Verify ownership
ls -ld /home/freeagent/projects/rdgtrans
ls -l /home/freeagent/projects/rdgtrans | head -10
```

**STEP 5: Verify Exclusions**
```bash
# Verify .git directory is NOT present
test -d /home/freeagent/projects/rdgtrans/.git && { echo "ERROR: .git directory found - should be excluded"; exit 1; } || echo "GOOD: .git excluded"

# Verify workorders directory is NOT present
test -d /home/freeagent/projects/rdgtrans/workorders && { echo "ERROR: workorders directory found - should be excluded"; exit 1; } || echo "GOOD: workorders excluded"

# Verify archive directory is NOT present
test -d /home/freeagent/projects/rdgtrans/archive && { echo "ERROR: archive directory found - should be excluded"; exit 1; } || echo "GOOD: archive excluded"

# Verify corrections directory is NOT present
test -d /home/freeagent/projects/rdgtrans/corrections && { echo "ERROR: corrections directory found - should be excluded"; exit 1; } || echo "GOOD: corrections excluded"
```

**STEP 6: Create README_CLONE.md**
```bash
sudo -u freeagent cat > /home/freeagent/projects/rdgtrans/README_CLONE.md <<'EOF'
# CLONE: rdgtrans-001

**Source Work Order:** WO-CLONE-RDGTRANS-001
**Created:** 2026-01-03
**Purpose:** Full rdgtrans exploration clone for Cursor jam sessions

## This is NOT Production

This clone is a **non-canonical sandbox** for:
- Exploration and learning
- Side projects and experiments
- Prototyping new features
- Understanding the codebase

**Changes made here are NOT automatically part of production.**

## Guardrails

### NEVER:
- ❌ Initialize a git repository (no `git init`)
- ❌ Commit or push to any remote
- ❌ Copy files from this clone back to production manually
- ❌ Treat any work here as canonical
- ❌ Write from Cursor to `/home/scott` paths

### Freedom:
- ✅ Modify any file in this clone
- ✅ Experiment without fear
- ✅ Break things and learn
- ✅ Create side projects
- ✅ Explore different approaches

## Production Integration

If you create something worth integrating into production:
1. Do NOT copy files manually
2. Create a MIGRATE Work Order (when ready)
3. Follow SSQS governance for production changes

**Current MIGRATE Status:** Not planned (exploration mode)

## Clone Details

- **Source:** `/home/scott/gitrepos/rdgtrans` (snapshot from 2026-01-03)
- **Excluded:** `.git/`, `workorders/`, `archive/`, `corrections/`, `output*/`, `__pycache__/`
- **Ownership:** freeagent:freeagent
- **Lifespan:** Disposable (can be deleted when no longer needed)

## Cursor Workspace

Point Cursor to this directory:
```
/home/freeagent/projects/rdgtrans
```

See `.cursorrules` for Cursor-specific guardrails.
EOF

# Verify creation
ls -l /home/freeagent/projects/rdgtrans/README_CLONE.md
```

**STEP 7: Create .cursorrules**
```bash
sudo -u freeagent cat > /home/freeagent/projects/rdgtrans/.cursorrules <<'EOF'
# Cursor Guardrails for CLONE rdgtrans-001

## Workspace Boundary

**MUST:** Work only in /home/freeagent/projects/rdgtrans
**NEVER:** Open or modify files in /home/scott (production)

## Git Restrictions

**NEVER:** Initialize git repository (`git init`)
**NEVER:** Commit or push changes
**NEVER:** Configure git remotes

This is a non-canonical sandbox. Git operations are forbidden.

## Production Protection

**NEVER:** Write to /home/scott/gitrepos/rdgtrans
**NEVER:** Copy files to production manually
**NEVER:** Execute commands that affect production paths

All production integration requires MIGRATE Work Order.

## Freedom to Explore

This clone is for:
- Exploration and learning
- Side projects and experiments
- Breaking things safely
- Trying new approaches

**You have full freedom to modify any file in this clone.**

## 10. RELATED MIGRATE WORK ORDER

**MIGRATE Work Order:** Not applicable at this time

**Note:** This clone is for exploratory work, side projects, and experimentation. Migration to production is not currently planned. If integration becomes desirable in the future, a separate MIGRATE Work Order can be created at that time.

---

## 11. NOTES & SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS

- This CLONE prioritizes **creative freedom** over migration planning
- Intended for exploration, learning, side projects, and experiments
- Not constrained by diff cleanliness or production integration concerns
- MIGRATE strategy (if ever needed) will be determined at that future time
- This establishes the baseline workflow for freeagent/Cursor jam sessions

---
