# WO-governance-v1-update-001

## SSQS v2 — Governance Update Work Order

---

## 0. WORK ORDER HEADER

**Work Order ID:** WO-governance-v1-update-001  
**Title:** Update governance documentation based on tmaster verification findings  
**Date Issued:** 2026-01-01  
**Supervisor:** Scott  
**Priority:** Normal  
**Summary:**  
Purposeful, process-aware update of governance documentation to align with findings from WO-TMASTER-v1-verification-002. This Work Order updates shared context and container specification documents only, with no impact on generated HTML artifacts.

---

## 1. PURPOSE

The purpose of this Work Order is to incorporate verified findings from the tmaster verification process into authoritative governance documentation. These updates clarify output artifact status, generator data flow, reporting conventions, and align the tmaster container specification explicitly with presmaster v3.0.0 validation rules.

This Work Order ensures governance accuracy before any remediation or transformation Work Orders are issued.

## 4. TASK DESCRIPTION

### Part A — sharedContext.md Updates

**File:**  
`/mnt/c/Users/scott/Documents/AIProjects/Markdown/RDGTranslations/sharedContext.md`

#### Change 1 — Section 7: Public Output

Add clarification that tmaster files are generated output artifacts:

```
**Generated Output Files:**
This directory contains GENERATED HTML files produced by Python scripts in pyhome/:
- tmaster*.html – Translation correction forms
- rdg*.html – Screen reader versions
- rdg*Print.html – Print-optimized versions
- RDGTranslations.html – Portal pages

These are OUTPUT artifacts. Source content lives in lmasters/.
```

#### Change 2 — Section 8: High-Level Data Flow

Expand to explicitly show generator script roles:

```
1. Source translations stored in lmasters/RDGBook_{Language}.md
2. Presentation structure defined in presentation.json (presmaster)
3. Python generator scripts in py/ process inputs:
   - generate_tmaster_*.py → tmaster*.html
   - Other generators for screen_reader and print_master
4. Generated HTML files output to output_V1/docs/
5. Translator corrections stored in corrections/
6. Public output optionally published to showoff repo
```

#### Change 3 — Section 6: Project Documentation

Add a new subsection:

```
