# WO-tmaster-korean-remediation-002

## 0. WORK ORDER HEADER

**Work Order ID:** WO-tmaster-korean-remediation-002  
**Title:** Remediation of tmasterKorean.html to Align with presmaster v3.0.0 and tmaster Spec v2.1  
**Date Issued:** 2026-01-01  
**Supervisor:** ChatGPT  
**Priority:** Normal  
**Type:** Transformation (Remediation)

**Summary:**  
Apply the same surgical remediations to `tmasterKorean.html` that were successfully applied to `tmasterVietnamese.html` in **WO-tmaster-vietnamese-remediation-001**, ensuring full conformance to **presmaster v3.0.0** validation rules and **tmaster_container_spec.md v2.1**.

---

## 1. PURPOSE

Remediate structural and attribute-level nonconformities in `tmasterKorean.html` so that the file conforms to current presentation-layer validation requirements and the tmaster container specification, without introducing behavioral or architectural changes.

## 3. EXECUTION MODEL (Sonnet / Haiku)

### 3.1 Sonnet Responsibilities
- Load and review:
  - This Work Order
  - `tmaster_container_spec.md` v2.1
  - `tmasterJapanese.html`
  - Remediated `tmasterVietnamese.html`
- Generate a deterministic execution plan
- Supervise Haiku execution
- Halt execution and escalate on ambiguity or spec conflict

### 3.2 Haiku Responsibilities
- Perform only the explicit transformations defined in this Work Order
- Make no speculative or inferred changes
- Preserve unrelated markup, ordering, and whitespace as-is

### 3.3 Execution Rule
Sonnet initiates and supervises execution.  
Haiku performs repo- or file-affecting changes exactly as planned.

## 4. TASK DESCRIPTION

Perform the following remediations on `tmasterKorean.html`, matching the Vietnamese remediation exactly in structure and intent, with Korean-specific substitutions where applicable:

1. Add missing `data-pr-type` attributes to all elements that contain a `data-pr-id` attribute, using values consistent with `tmaster_container_spec.md` v2.1.
2. Insert missing required PR elements:
   - `pr_14`
   - `pr_37`
   Placement, structure, and attributes must mirror the Vietnamese remediation.
3. Add Korean language bindings for:
   - `pr_21`
   - `pr_26`
   Use Korean-language strings and identifiers, following the same pattern used for Vietnamese and Japanese.
4. Verify and remediate submit button implementation so that it matches `tmasterJapanese.html` exactly in structure, attributes, and behavior.

No other changes are permitted.

## 12. CORRECTIVE ACTION NOTICE

**Date:** 2026-01-02
**Status:** ⚠️ SUPERSEDED BY MASS CORRECTIVE ACTION
