# Work Order: Update Session Start Document for SSQS v2 Integration
Work Order ID: WO-SSQS-v2-SessionStart-Update-001  
Title: Integrate SSQS v2 Template & Sonnet/Haiku Execution Model into Session Start Document  
Date Issued: 2025-12-11  
Supervisor: Scott Tobias  
Priority: High  

## Summary
Update the authoritative Session Start Document to reference the new SSQS v2 Work Order Template and to define Sonnet/Haiku execution governance at the session initialization level. This ensures Claude Code reliably enforces SSQS v2 during all work sessions.

---

## 1. PURPOSE
To update the Session Start document so that Sonnet:
- knows the location of the SSQS v2 Work Order Template  
- treats it as authoritative  
- validates all Work Orders against it  
- applies the correct Sonnet/Haiku execution model  
- ensures deterministic, Haiku-safe execution  
- maintains system consistency across sessions

## 3. EXECUTION MODEL (Sonnet / Haiku)

### 3.1 Sonnet Responsibilities
Sonnet updates the Session Start Document according to this Work Order.  
Sonnet must:
- generate a deterministic plan  
- validate metadata  
- rewrite or insert the required reference block  
- ensure the Session Start Document reflects:  
  - SSQS v2 Template location  
  - SSQS v2 authority  
  - Sonnet/Haiku execution rules  
  - Copilot suspension  
- coordinate exception handling  

Sonnet must **not** directly modify repository files unless explicitly authorized — which this Work Order does authorize.

### 3.2 Haiku Responsibilities
Haiku must:
- apply the actual modifications to the Session Start document  
- create a copy in `supervisor_updates/`  
- perform only deterministic patching  
- halt on unexpected behavior  

### 3.3 Execution Rule
Sonnet plans and delegates the repo edits to Haiku.

---

## 4. TASK DESCRIPTION
Modify the Session Start Document (`dochome/session_start/SessionStart.md`) by inserting or updating the section that defines:
1. SSQS v2 Work Order Template reference  
2. Sonnet/Haiku Execution Model  
3. Copilot Suspension Rule  
4. Required Session Initialization Behavior  

---

## 5. METADATA FOR EXECUTION

### 5.1 File Inventory
```
dochome/session_start/SessionStart.md
```

### 5.2 Insert Location
Insert or update the section titled:
```
SSQS Compliance & Execution Model
```
If no such section exists, create it immediately after the document header.

### 5.3 Template Path
```
dochome/SSQS/SSQS_v2_WorkOrder_Template.md
```

### 5.4 Versioning
Add:
```
Session Start Document Version: 2.0
SSQS Version: 2.0
```

---

## 6. PLAN OF EXECUTION (Generated by Sonnet)
*Sonnet will generate this when the Work Order is executed in VS Code.*

---

## 7. EXECUTION (Performed by Haiku)
*Haiku will perform deterministic edits based on Sonnet’s plan.*

---

## 8. ERROR HANDLING & ESCALATION

### 8.1 Haiku Behavior
Stop, report exact error, return control to Sonnet.

### 8.2 Sonnet Behavior
Analyze, request clarification if needed, generate a corrected plan.

---

## 9. DELIVERABLES
- Updated `SessionStart.md` in `dochome/session_start/`  
- Mirror copy in `supervisor_updates/WO-SSQS-v2-SessionStart-Update-001/`  
- Confirmation summary from Sonnet  

---

## 10. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- Session Start Document references SSQS v2 template  
- Sonnet/Haiku model documented accurately  
- Copilot suspension rule included  
- All paths correct  
- Document version updated  
- No unauthorized file changes  
- New version appears in `supervisor_updates/`
