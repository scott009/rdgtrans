# Work Order: Verify tMaster HTML Files Against Thai Reference (No Modifications)
Work Order ID: WO-tMaster-Verification-001  
Title: Verification Pass on tMaster HTML Files Using tmasterThai.html as Reference  
Date Issued: 2025-12-11  
Supervisor: Scott Tobias  
Priority: High  

## Summary
This Work Order performs a **verification-only** pass on all tMaster HTML files, using `tmasterThai.html` as the reference model.  
No files are to be modified. The goal is to discover the current state of all tMaster documents, compare them structurally and semantically to the Thai reference, and produce a structured report for the Supervisor in `supervisor_updates/`.  

`tmasterThai.html` is accepted as complete and must **not** be altered in any way.

---

## 1. PURPOSE
- Identify all existing tMaster HTML files in the project.  
- Treat `tmasterThai.html` as the **authoritative reference model** for structure and metadata.  
- Compare each other tMaster file to this reference and document:
  - structural differences  
  - missing or extra sections  
  - inconsistent metadata or headers  
  - significant deviations that might affect translation or presentation  
- Produce a **verification report** summarizing findings.  
- Make **no changes** to any tMaster files (including `tmasterThai.html`).  

This is the first production use of the SSQS v2 system and must remain strictly read-only with respect to content.

---

## 2. SCOPE & BOUNDARIES

### 2.1 Allowed Directories
The executor may **read** files from:
- `dochome/` and its subdirectories  
- any subdirectory under `dochome/` that contains `tmaster*.html` files  
- `supervisor_updates/` (for writing the verification report only)

### 2.2 Forbidden Directories
The executor must **not** read or write in:
- any `archive/` subdirectory (e.g., `showoff/archive/`)  
- `workorders/`  
- `src/`  
- `dist/`  
- `assets/` (unless a tMaster file happens to live there, which is unlikely)

### 2.3 File Types in Scope
- `.html` (for tMaster files)  
- `.md` (for the verification report to be written into `supervisor_updates/`)  

---

## 3. EXECUTION MODEL (Sonnet / Haiku)

### 3.1 Sonnet Responsibilities
Sonnet must:
- Interpret this Work Order under SSQS v2 governance.  
- Discover all tMaster HTML files by searching for `tmaster*.html` under `dochome/`, **excluding any `archive/` subtrees**.  
- Positively identify which file is `tmasterThai.html` and confirm its path.  
- Generate a deterministic plan for:
  - reading all tMaster files  
  - comparing their structure to `tmasterThai.html`  
  - summarizing findings in a report  
- Ensure **no file modifications** are requested of Haiku.  
- Ensure `tmasterThai.html` is treated as read-only and used purely as a reference.

### 3.2 Haiku Responsibilities
Haiku must:
- Perform read-only operations on tMaster HTML files (no writes).  
- Create the verification report file(s) in `supervisor_updates/WO-tMaster-Verification-001/`.  
- Ensure that **no tMaster files are created, modified, or deleted**.  
- Halt and report an error if any operation would modify a tMaster file.

### 3.3 Execution Rule
**This is a verification-only Work Order.**  
Haiku must not modify any existing `.html` files.  
The only permitted writes are:
- creation of new report files in `supervisor_updates/WO-tMaster-Verification-001/`.

---

## 4. TASK DESCRIPTION

1. Locate all tMaster HTML files by searching for filenames matching:
   - `tmaster*.html`  

2. Identify the Thai reference file:
   - `tmasterThai.html`  

3. For each non-Thai tMaster file:
   - Compare the **overall structure** to `tmasterThai.html`, including:
     - presence and order of major sections  
     - key container elements or blocks  
     - expected metadata/header region  
     - placeholders or markers used for translated content  

4. Record, for each file:
   - file path  
   - whether it appears structurally consistent with `tmasterThai.html`  
   - any missing or extra sections  
   - any obvious header/metadata mismatches  
   - any anomalies that may affect translation or HTML generation later  

5. Do **not** correct or change anything.  
   All results go into a report for human review.

---

## 5. METADATA FOR EXECUTION

### 5.1 Discovery Instructions
Sonnet may use file-search or globbing strategies (e.g., `find`, `rg`, internal tools) to locate:
- all `tmaster*.html` files under `dochome/`, excluding any `archive/` directories.

### 5.2 Reference File
- Reference tMaster file: `tmasterThai.html`  
- Role: canonical structural example for this Work Order  
- Constraint: **must not be modified**.

### 5.3 Report Output Location
All reports must be written into:
- `supervisor_updates/WO-tMaster-Verification-001/`

Recommend at least:
- `tMasterVerificationReport.md`

---

## 6. PLAN OF EXECUTION (Generated by Sonnet)
Sonnet must generate, at minimum, a plan that includes:

1. Method for discovering tMaster files.  
2. Method for reading `tmasterThai.html` as the reference.  
3. A comparison approach that is:
   - deterministic  
   - repeatable  
   - focused on structure and metadata, not content translation quality  
4. A specific schema for the verification report (e.g., per-file subsections with findings).  

This plan must be documented in the session transcript and/or in the report’s header.

---

## 7. EXECUTION (Performed by Haiku)
Haiku must:
- Execute Sonnet’s plan **without modifying any `.html` files**.  
- Only create or modify files under:
  - `supervisor_updates/WO-tMaster-Verification-001/`  

If any step would require editing a tMaster file, Haiku must:
- stop  
- report the attempted action  
- return control to Sonnet without making the change.

---

## 8. ERROR HANDLING & ESCALATION

### 8.1 Haiku Behavior
Haiku must halt and report if:
- `tmasterThai.html` cannot be found;  
- no `tmaster*.html` files are discovered;  
- any attempt to write to a `.html` file is triggered.

### 8.2 Sonnet Behavior
Sonnet must:
- Diagnose missing reference or zero-file conditions.  
- Ask the Supervisor for clarification if critical assumptions fail (e.g., naming or location issues).  
- Update the plan only in ways that preserve the **read-only** nature of this Work Order.

---

## 9. DELIVERABLES

At minimum, Haiku must produce:

- `supervisor_updates/WO-tMaster-Verification-001/tMasterVerificationReport.md`  

This report should include:

- A list of all discovered tMaster files, with paths.  
- Identification of the reference file (`tmasterThai.html`).  
- Per-file sections describing:
  - structural alignment with the reference  
  - key differences and missing pieces  
  - notes on potential future clean-up work (to be done in subsequent Work Orders).  

---

## 10. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

- `tmasterThai.html` is confirmed present, read-only, and used as a reference.  
- All `tmaster*.html` files (excluding any under `archive/`) are listed in the report.  
- No `.html` files are modified, created, or deleted.  
- At least one Markdown report file exists under:
  - `supervisor_updates/WO-tMaster-Verification-001/`  
- The report clearly identifies:
  - per-file status  
  - structural differences vs. Thai reference  
  - suggested follow-up actions (descriptive only).  

---

## 11. NOTES & SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS

- This is the **first production Work Order** under SSQS v2 and is intentionally conservative.  
- Future Work Orders may perform **repairs or normalization** of tMaster files based on this report.  
- This Work Order does **not** touch `.gitignore` or any archive directories; those concerns are explicitly deferred.
